  "claude_response": "I'll help you install Metabase v0.56.9 following the Solutions Team standards. Let me start by researching the repository to determine the best installation method.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the Repository\nLet me check the GitHub releases page to see if v0.56.9 exists and get the exact download URL:\nPerfect! Now let me get the SHA256 checksum for the JAR file:\nGood! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the directory and installation script.\n\n## Step 2: Creating Directory Structure\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n\nBased on my research, Metabase is a Java-based application distributed as a JAR file. The prerequisites are:\n- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** - version 11 or higher (I'll use OpenJDK 11)\n\nInstallation method: **Binary download (JAR file)**\n\nLet me create the complete installation script:\n## Step 4: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2705 Script saved successfully!\n\n## Step 5: Validate the Script with Shellcheck and Bash Syntax\n\u2705 **Shellcheck passed** - No issues found!\n\u2705 **Bash syntax check passed** - Script syntax is valid!\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\n\nNow let me create a Docker test environment and test the installation:\nNow create the Dockerfile:\nNow let's build and test the Docker container:\nExcellent! The Docker build was successful! Now let's verify the installation by running the version command:\nPerfect! \u2705 The installation works correctly! Now let's test idempotency by running the script again:\nPerfect! \u2705 **Idempotency test passed!** The script correctly detected the existing installation and didn't reinstall.\n\nNow let's clean up the Docker test environment:\nPerfect! All tests completed successfully. Let me create a final summary:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Installation Complete - Summary\n\n### Repository Analysis\nI successfully analyzed the Metabase repository and determined that:\n- **Tool**: Metabase v0.56.9\n- **Type**: Java-based Business Intelligence application\n- **Distribution**: JAR file download from official releases\n- **Installation Method**: Binary download (JAR)\n\n### Prerequisites Identified\n- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: OpenJDK 11 or higher\n\n### Script Location\n\u2705 **Script saved at**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_064305/tools/metabase/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Validation Results\n\n#### \u2705 Shellcheck\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- No issues found\n\n#### \u2705 Bash Syntax Check\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Script syntax is valid\n\n#### \u2705 Docker Build & Test\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Build completed successfully\n- Installation works correctly\n- Version verification: `Metabase v0.56.9`\n\n#### \u2705 Idempotency Test\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Script correctly detects existing installation\n- No changes made on second run\n- Exit code: 0\n\n### Key Features of the Installation Script\n\n1. **Prerequisite Management**:\n   - Detects existing Java installation\n   - Installs OpenJDK 11 if missing\n   - Verifies Java works before proceeding\n   - Supports multiple package managers (apt-get, yum, apk)\n\n2. **Installation Process**:\n   - Downloads official Metabase JAR from `https://downloads.metabase.com/v0.56.9.x/metabase.jar`\n   - Installs to `/opt/metabase/metabase.jar`\n   - Creates wrapper script at `/usr/local/bin/metabase`\n   - Handles `--version` flag correctly\n\n3. **Quality Standards Met**:\n   - \u2705 Idempotent (can run multiple times safely)\n   - \u2705 Version pinned (v0.56.9)\n   - \u2705 Non-interactive\n   - \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n   - \u2705 Graceful error handling\n   - \u2705 Clean package manager caches\n   - \u2705 Validation function works correctly\n   - \u2705 No secrets embedded\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**Binary Download (JAR)** - Metabase is distributed as a compiled JAR file that can be run directly with Java. This is the simplest and most reliable installation method for Metabase.\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\nBased on the installation I just completed, here's the complexity assessment:\n\n### Analysis\n\nMetabase is a Java application distributed as a pre-compiled JAR file, making it relatively straightforward to install. The primary complexity comes from ensuring Java is available, but since Java 11 is a common and well-supported runtime, this is a low barrier. The installation involves:\n\n1. **Prerequisites**: Only Java 11+ required - a very common runtime available in all major package managers\n2. **Installation Method**: Direct binary download (JAR file) - no compilation needed\n3. **Special Requirements**: Simple wrapper script creation for command-line convenience, version extraction from JAR manifest\n\nThe installation is clean, straightforward, and highly portable across different Linux distributions. The idempotency checks are simple (file existence and version validation), and there are no complex build dependencies or multi-stage compilation processes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Metabase installation has low complexity. It requires only Java 11+ as a prerequisite, which is widely available in all package managers. The installation is a simple binary download of a pre-compiled JAR file with no compilation required.
