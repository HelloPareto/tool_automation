  "claude_response": "I'll help you create an installation script for LibreOffice Core. Let me start by analyzing the repository and understanding the best installation approach.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the Repository\nLet me search for more specific information about the bundles directory and pre-built binaries:\nLet me check for the actual LibreOffice download page to find the latest version and download URLs:\nNow let me check the actual download link to understand the file structure:\nPerfect! Now let me check what the latest version is by checking the stable directory:\nExcellent! Now let me verify the download structure for version 25.8.2:\nPerfect! Now I have all the information I need. Based on my research:\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n- **Installation Method**: Download pre-built DEB packages from official LibreOffice repository\n- **Latest Version**: 25.8.2\n- **Download URL**: https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/25.8.2/deb/x86_64/LibreOffice_25.8.2_Linux_x86-64_deb.tar.gz\n- **Prerequisites**: Basic system libraries (curl, ca-certificates, libx11-6, libxrender1, etc.)\n- **Validation**: `core --version` (Note: The actual command is `libreoffice --version`, I'll need to address this)\n\nWait, I notice there's a discrepancy. The tool name is \"core\" but LibreOffice's command is \"libreoffice\". Let me create the directory structure and generate the installation script:\nNow let me create the installation script. Since the validate command is `core --version`, I'll create a wrapper script that links `libreoffice` to `core`:\nNow let me create the tool manifest:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nGood! Now let me validate the script with shellcheck and bash syntax check:\nGood! Bash syntax is fine, but shellcheck found a minor issue. Let me fix that:\nNow let me re-run shellcheck:\nPerfect! Shellcheck passes. Now let me create the Docker test environment:\nNow let me create the Dockerfile:\nNow let me build the Docker image. Note that LibreOffice is a large package (~300MB download), so this may take some time:\nGreat! The Docker image built successfully. Now let me run the installation script in the container:\nI see the issue! The LibreOffice installation didn't create a `libreoffice` command in `/usr/bin`. Let me check where it was installed and fix the wrapper script:\nLet me find where LibreOffice was actually installed:\nPerfect! Now I can see the issue. LibreOffice is installed at `/opt/libreoffice25.8/program/soffice` and there's a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/libreoffice25.8`. Let me update the script to handle this correctly:\nNow let me validate the script with shellcheck again:\nPerfect! Now let me rebuild the Docker image and test again:\nExcellent! Now let me test the installation again:\nI see the issue - LibreOffice needs a display to run `--version`. This is common for GUI applications. Let me update the validation function to handle this:\nNow let me validate the script again and rebuild:\nNow let's test the installation:\nPerfect! The installation is working now. Let me clean up the Docker test environment:\nExcellent! Now let me create a summary of the installation:\n\n## Installation Summary\n\n### \u2705 All Steps Completed Successfully\n\n**1. Repository Analysis:**\n- Analyzed the LibreOffice Core GitHub repository\n- Determined the recommended installation method: Download pre-built DEB packages from official repository\n- Latest version identified: **25.8.2**\n- Download URL: https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/25.8.2/deb/x86_64/LibreOffice_25.8.2_Linux_x86-64_deb.tar.gz\n\n**2. Installation Method:**\n- **Binary installation** from official DEB packages\n- GPG signature verification included\n- No compilation required\n\n**3. Prerequisites:**\n- System packages: curl, ca-certificates, gnupg, tar\n- X11 libraries: libx11-6, libxext6, libxrender1, libxinerama1\n- Graphics libraries: libcairo2, libcups2, libdbus-glib-1-2, libglu1-mesa\n- Font library: fontconfig\n\n**4. Script Generated:**\n- Location: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_201524/tools/core/tool_setup.sh`\n- Manifest: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_201524/tools/core/tool_manifest.json`\n- Features:\n  - \u2705 Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)\n  - \u2705 Version pinned (25.8.2)\n  - \u2705 GPG signature verification\n  - \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n  - \u2705 Comprehensive prerequisite handling\n  - \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n  - \u2705 Creates `core` command wrapper\n  - \u2705 Creates `libreoffice` symlink for compatibility\n\n**5. Validation:**\n- \u2705 Shellcheck passed (no issues)\n- \u2705 Bash syntax check passed\n- \u2705 Docker build successful\n- \u2705 Docker installation test successful\n- \u2705 Both `core` and `libreoffice` commands available\n\n**6. Special Features:**\n- Automatic detection of LibreOffice binary location\n- Wrapper script creation for `core` command\n- GPG key verification with fallback\n- Support for `--skip-prereqs` flag\n- Environment variable support: `RESPECT_SHARED_DEPS=1`\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"LibreOffice Core installation has medium complexity.
