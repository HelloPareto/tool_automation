  "claude_response": "I'll install Metabase v0.56.9 following the specifications. Let me start by analyzing the repository to determine the best installation method.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Repository\nLet me get more specific information about the exact download URL and verify the release:\nLet me check the actual JAR file and get its checksum:\nGood! The JAR file exists. Now let me create the directory structure and generate the installation script:\nNow let me get the SHA256 checksum for the JAR file:\nPerfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the installation script:\n\n## Step 2-4: Generate Installation Script with Prerequisites\n\nBased on my analysis:\n- **Installation Method**: Binary JAR download (Metabase is a Java application)\n- **Prerequisites**: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11 or higher\n- **Download URL**: https://downloads.metabase.com/v0.56.9/metabase.jar\n- **SHA256**: 2ec02d9d909aa11cb5ccb34723776f9c2ddfb0dc6ea5b867ca649a9cfa282621\nNow let me create the manifest file:\n## Step 5: Verify the Script\nGood! The script was saved correctly. Now let's validate it:\n\n## Step 6: Validate with shellcheck and bash syntax check\nPerfect! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed with no errors.\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nNow let's build the Docker image:\nPerfect! The Docker image was built successfully. Now let's run the installation script inside the container:\nExcellent! The installation completed successfully. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me verify the files were saved correctly:\nPerfect! All files are in place. Now let me provide a comprehensive summary.\n\n---\n\n## Installation Summary\n\n### \u2705 All Steps Completed Successfully\n\n**Installation Method Used:** Binary JAR download with Java runtime\n\n**Repository Analysis:**\n- Analyzed the Metabase GitHub repository and official documentation\n- Determined Metabase v0.56.9 is distributed as a JAR file (Java application)\n- Downloaded from: https://downloads.metabase.com/v0.56.9/metabase.jar\n- SHA256 Checksum: `2ec02d9d909aa11cb5ccb34723776f9c2ddfb0dc6ea5b867ca649a9cfa282621`\n\n**Prerequisites Identified:**\n- Java Runtime Environment (OpenJDK 11 JRE headless)\n- curl (for downloading)\n- coreutils (for sha256sum verification)\n\n**Script Features:**\n\u2705 Prerequisite detection and installation (Java 11)\n\u2705 Idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)\n\u2705 Version pinning (v0.56.9)\n\u2705 Checksum verification (SHA256)\n\u2705 Non-interactive installation\n\u2705 Proper error handling and logging\n\u2705 Support for `--skip-prereqs` flag and `RESPECT_SHARED_DEPS` environment variable\n\u2705 Wrapper script for easy execution\n\u2705 Clean directory structure\n\n**Files Created:**\n1. `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_201524/tools/metabase/tool_setup.sh` (9.9KB)\n2. `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_201524/tools/metabase/tool_manifest.json` (773B)\n\n**Validation Results:**\n\u2705 Shellcheck: Passed (no errors)\n\u2705 Bash syntax check: Passed\n\u2705 Docker build: Successful\n\u2705 Docker installation test: **Successful**\n   - Prerequisites installed correctly\n   - JAR downloaded and checksum verified\n   - Wrapper script created\n   - `metabase --version` returns: **\"Metabase v0.56.9\"** \u2713\n\n**Installation Details:**\n- Install location: `/opt/metabase/metabase.jar`\n- Wrapper script: `/usr/local/bin/metabase`\n- Default port: 3000 (when started)\n- Requires: ~489MB JAR file, ~232MB additional space for Java dependencies\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Metabase v0.56.9 installation is relatively straightforward with low-to-medium complexity. The tool is distributed as a pre-built JAR file requiring only Java 11 as a runtime dependency, eliminating the need for compilation. The main complexity comes from downloading a large (~490MB) JAR file and setting up Java, but the installation process itself is simple and well-documented.
