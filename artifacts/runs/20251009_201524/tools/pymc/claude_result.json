  "claude_response": "I'll install PyMC v5.25.1 following the specifications. Let me start by analyzing the repository to determine the best installation method.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the Repository\nLet me fetch more specific details about PyMC's installation requirements and dependencies.\nNow let me check the GitHub repository directly for more details about dependencies and validation.\nNow let me check if PyMC has a CLI tool that responds to `--version`:\n## Analysis Summary\n\nBased on my research:\n\n1. **Installation Method**: PyMC is a Python package available on PyPI. The best installation method is `pip install pymc==5.25.1`\n2. **Prerequisites**: \n   - Python 3.10 or higher (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 supported)\n   - pip package manager\n3. **Binary Wheels**: Available (pymc-5.25.1-py3-none-any.whl), so no compilation needed\n4. **Validation Issue**: PyMC is a Python library, NOT a CLI tool. The command `pymc --version` will NOT work. The correct validation is to use Python to check the version: `python3 -c \"import pymc; print(pymc.__version__)\"`\n\nLet me create the directory structure and generate the installation script.\nNow I'll create the installation script with proper prerequisite handling:\nNow let me create the manifest file:\nLet me verify the files were created correctly:\nPerfect! Now let's validate the script with shellcheck and bash syntax check:\nExcellent! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed. Now let's test the script in a Docker container:\nNow let's build and test the Docker container:\nGreat! The Docker image built successfully. Now let's run the installation script inside the container:\nPerfect! The installation was successful. Now let's clean up the Docker resources:\nExcellent! Let me verify the files one more time:\nPerfect! Now let me provide a comprehensive summary of the installation process.\n\n---\n\n## **Installation Summary for PyMC v5.25.1**\n\n### \u2705 **All Steps Completed Successfully**\n\n#### **1. Repository Analysis**\n- **Repository**: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc\n- **Method Determined**: pip install (Python package from PyPI)\n- **Research Findings**:\n  - PyMC is a pure Python package available on PyPI\n  - Binary wheels available (no compilation needed)\n  - Requires Python 3.10 or higher\n  - Main dependencies: pytensor, numpy, scipy, pandas, arviz\n\n#### **2. Prerequisites Detected**\n- **Runtime**: Python 3.10+\n- **Package Manager**: pip3\n- **System Libraries**: python3-dev, build-essential (for dependencies that may need compilation)\n- **Additional Tools**: ca-certificates, curl\n\n#### **3. Installation Approach**\n- **Method**: pip install pymc==5.25.1\n- **Complexity**: Low (straightforward Python package)\n- **Version Pinning**: \u2705 Exact version pinned\n- **Idempotency**: \u2705 Script checks for existing installation\n\n#### **4. Script Generated**\n- **Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_201524/tools/pymc/tool_setup.sh`\n- **Features**:\n  - \u2705 Prerequisite detection and installation\n  - \u2705 Idempotent execution\n  - \u2705 Version pinning (5.25.1)\n  - \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n  - \u2705 Supports `--skip-prereqs` flag\n  - \u2705 Respects `RESPECT_SHARED_DEPS` environment variable\n  - \u2705 Comprehensive logging with timestamps\n  - \u2705 Graceful error handling\n  - \u2705 No apt cache cleanup (per standards)\n\n#### **5. Validation**\n- **Shellcheck**: \u2705 Passed with no issues\n- **Bash Syntax**: \u2705 Passed with no issues\n- **Docker Test**: \u2705 Successfully installed and validated\n  - Installation time: ~2 minutes\n  - PyMC version confirmed: 5.25.1\n  - All dependencies installed correctly\n\n#### **6. Manifest File**\n- **Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251009_201524/tools/pymc/tool_manifest.json`\n- **Validation Command**: `python3 -c \"import pymc; print(f'pymc {pymc.__version__}')\"`\n- **Note**: The original validation command `pymc --version` is not applicable since PyMC is a Python library, not a CLI tool.\n\n#### **7. Installation Method Used**\n**pip** (Python Package Installer) - The industry-standard method for installing Python packages from PyPI.\n\n---\n\n### **Important Notes**\n\n1. **Validation Command Update**: The specified validation command `pymc --version` does not work because PyMC is a Python library, not a command-line tool. The correct validation is: `python3 -c \"import pymc; print(f'pymc {pymc.__version__}')\"`\n\n2. **Prerequisites**: The script automatically installs Python 3.10+ if not present, along with pip and necessary build tools.\n\n3. **Idempotency**: Running the script multiple times is safe and will skip installation if PyMC v5.25.1 is already installed.\n\n4. **Dependencies**: PyMC has many scientific computing dependencies (numpy, scipy, pandas, pytensor, arviz) which are automatically installed by pip.\n\n---\n\n## **Complexity Assessment**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"PyMC v5.25.1 is a straightforward Python package installation with low complexity. The package is available on PyPI with pre-built binary wheels, eliminating the need for source compilation. The main prerequisite is Python 3.10+, which is a common runtime.
