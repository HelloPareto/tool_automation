  "claude_response": "I'll install Apache Superset version superset-helm-chart-0.15.1 following the standards. Let me start by researching the repository.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Repository\nNow let me check the specific version and understand the tool better:\nGood! Now let me examine the repository to understand the installation method:\nPerfect! Now I understand. This is a **Helm chart** installation for Apache Superset. The version `superset-helm-chart-0.15.1` refers to the Helm chart version, not the Superset application itself. Based on my analysis:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. **Installation Method**: Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment\n2. **Prerequisites**: Helm 3.x, Kubernetes cluster access, kubectl\n3. **Validation Command Issue**: The validate command `superset --version` won't work because Helm charts deploy to Kubernetes, not local CLI installation\n\nLet me clean up and create the installation script:\nNow let me create the installation script. Since this is a Helm chart, I'll install Helm CLI and set up the chart, and adjust the validation to check Helm chart installation:\nNow let me create the manifest file:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly and validate it:\nExcellent! Shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed. Now let's test in Docker:\nNow let's build and test the Docker image:\nGreat! Docker image built successfully. Now let's run the installation script:\nI see the issue! The Helm chart version 0.15.1 is **not published** to the public repository. According to the web search results, there was an issue where version 0.15.1 was released but not published. The latest available version is 0.15.0.\n\nLet me verify this and adjust to use 0.15.0, or I need to check if 0.15.1 is available via GitHub directly:\nConfirmed! The issue is that version 0.15.1 exists as a GitHub tag but was **never published** to the Helm repository at https://apache.github.io/superset. This is a known issue. \n\nSince the user specifically requested `superset-helm-chart-0.15.1`, I have two options:\n1. Use the GitHub source directly (not typical for Helm charts)\n2. Document this issue and provide a working solution\n\nLet me update the script to handle this by installing the chart directly from the GitHub source:\nNow I need to update the validation function to check for the packaged chart:\nNow update the usage information to reflect both installation methods:\nNow I need to add git to the prerequisites since we'll need it to clone the repository:\nNow let's validate the updated script:\nGood! Now let's rebuild and test:\nPerfect! Now let's run the installation script:\nExcellent! The installation was successful! The script:\n1. Installed Helm 3.16.3\n2. Added the Superset Helm repository\n3. Detected that version 0.15.1 is not in the public repository\n4. Cloned the GitHub repository at the specific tag\n5. Packaged the Helm chart from source\n6. Validated everything\n\nLet's test idempotency by running it again:\nPerfect! Idempotency works! On the second run, it detected that Helm and the repository were already set up and skipped to validation. Now let's clean up:\nNow let's update the manifest to reflect the final solution:\nPerfect! Let me verify all files are in place:\nExcellent! Now let me provide the final summary and complexity assessment:\n\n## Summary\n\n\u2705 **All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Installation Approach\nI installed **Apache Superset Helm Chart version 0.15.1** using a hybrid approach:\n\n1. **Helm CLI Installation**: Downloaded and installed Helm 3.16.3 (the Kubernetes package manager)\n2. **Repository Configuration**: Added the official Apache Superset Helm repository\n3. **GitHub Source Packaging**: Since version 0.15.1 was released on GitHub but **never published** to the official Helm repository, the script:\n   - Clones the Superset repository at the specific tag `superset-helm-chart-0.15.1`\n   - Downloads Helm chart dependencies (PostgreSQL and Redis)\n   - Packages the chart from source into `/tmp/superset-0.15.1.tgz`\n\n### Key Features\n- \u2705 **Idempotent**: Second run detects existing installation and skips to validation\n- \u2705 **Prerequisite Handling**: Installs curl, wget, tar, git, ca-certificates\n- \u2705 **Version Pinned**: Helm 3.16.3, Superset chart 0.15.1\n- \u2705 **Checksum Verified**: SHA256 verification for Helm download\n- \u2705 **Non-Interactive**: Fully automated installation\n- \u2705 **Shellcheck Passed**: No linting issues\n- \u2705 **Docker Tested**: Successfully tested in Ubuntu 22.04 container\n\n### Files Created\n1. **tool_setup.sh**: Complete installation script (13KB)\n2. **tool_manifest.json**: Metadata and prerequisites manifest\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**Helm** - This is a Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment, not a standalone CLI tool. The validation command `superset --version` from the requirements doesn't apply since this installs the chart packaging tools, not the Superset application itself.\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Apache Superset Helm chart installation has medium complexity.
