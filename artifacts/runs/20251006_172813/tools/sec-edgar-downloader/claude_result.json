  "claude_response": "I'll install sec-edgar-downloader version 5.0.3 following the specified standards. Let me start by creating the directory structure and then generate a complete installation script with proper prerequisite handling.\nNow I'll generate the complete installation script with prerequisite detection and handling:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nGood! The script was saved correctly. Now let me validate it with shellcheck and bash syntax checking:\nShellcheck reports a minor warning about an unused variable. Let me fix this by removing the unused PYTHON_MIN_VERSION variable:\nNow let me rerun shellcheck to confirm it passes:\nPerfect! Shellcheck passes with no errors. Now let me create the Docker test environment:\nNow let me copy the script to the test directory:\nNow let me build the Docker image:\nPerfect! The Docker build succeeded. Now let me run the validation command to confirm the tool is working correctly:\nLet me fix the validation command to use python3 instead of python:\nExcellent! The validation passed successfully. Now let me test idempotency by running the installation script again:\nPerfect! The script is idempotent - it detected the existing installation and validated it without reinstalling. Now let me clean up the Docker resources:\nPerfect! Let me create a final summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Installation Summary \u2705\n\n**All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Tool Details\n- **Tool Name**: sec-edgar-downloader\n- **Version**: 5.0.3\n- **Installation Method**: pip (Python package manager)\n- **Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/sec-edgar-downloader/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Validation Results\n\n#### \u2705 Shellcheck\n- **Status**: PASSED (no errors or warnings)\n- Static analysis completed successfully\n\n#### \u2705 Bash Syntax Check\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- No syntax errors detected\n\n#### \u2705 Docker Build Test\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Successfully built Docker image with the installation script\n- Prerequisites (Python 3.10.12, pip) were automatically detected and installed\n- sec-edgar-downloader 5.0.3 installed successfully\n- All dependencies installed: requests, pyrate-limiter, charset_normalizer, idna, urllib3, certifi\n\n#### \u2705 Validation Command\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Command: `python3 -c 'import sec_edgar_downloader; print(sec_edgar_downloader.__version__)'`\n- Output: `5.0.3` \u2713\n\n#### \u2705 Idempotency Test\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Re-running the script detected existing installation and validated without reinstalling\n- Exit code 0 on second run\n\n### Key Features of the Installation Script\n\n1. **Prerequisite Management**: \n   - Detects if Python 3 and pip3 are already installed\n   - Automatically installs missing prerequisites\n   - Verifies prerequisites work correctly before proceeding\n\n2. **Idempotent**: \n   - Safe to run multiple times\n   - Detects existing installations and validates them\n   - No duplicate installations or errors\n\n3. **Version Pinning**: \n   - Exact version 5.0.3 pinned\n   - Ensures consistent installations\n\n4. **Multi-Platform Support**: \n   - Supports apt-get (Debian/Ubuntu)\n   - Supports yum (RHEL/CentOS)\n   - Supports apk (Alpine)\n\n5. **Clear Logging**: \n   - Timestamps on all log entries\n   - Clear progress indicators\n   - Actionable error messages\n\n6. **Validation**: \n   - Comprehensive validation checks\n   - Verifies correct version installed\n   - Returns appropriate exit codes\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Met \u2705\n\n\u2705 Prerequisites detected and documented  \n\u2705 Script checks for existing prerequisites before installing  \n\u2705 Missing prerequisites installed automatically  \n\u2705 Prerequisites verified before tool installation  \n\u2705 Idempotent (re-run = no changes, exits 0)  \n\u2705 Version pinned (5.0.3)  \n\u2705 Non-interactive install  \n\u2705 Approved repos and keyring locations  \n\u2705 Cache cleaned after installation  \n\u2705 Validation command works correctly  \n\u2705 Shellcheck passes with no errors  \n\u2705 No secrets in script  \n\u2705 Clear logging with timestamps  \n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"This is a straightforward Python package installation with very low complexity.
