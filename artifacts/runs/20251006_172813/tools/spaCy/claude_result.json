  "claude_response": "I'll install spaCy version release-v3.8.7 following the specifications. Let me start by analyzing the requirements and then proceed with the installation.\n\n## Analysis\n\nLooking at the provided information, I notice some issues:\n- The validate command `python -c 'import spacy/git_info.py; print(spacy/git_info.py.__version__)'` appears malformed (should be `import spacy` not `import spacy/git_info.py`)\n- The package name `spacy/git_info.py` is incorrect (should be `spacy`)\n- The binary pattern shows a wheel file, suggesting this is a Python package\n\nI'll proceed with the correct spaCy installation approach using pip for the Python package.\n\nLet me start:\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Prerequisites Detection\n\nFor spaCy, the prerequisites are:\n- **Python 3** (required)\n- **pip** (Python package manager)\n- **Build tools** (gcc, g++, make) - spaCy may have compiled components\n- **Python development headers** (python3-dev)\n\n## Step 3 & 4: Generate the installation script with prerequisite handling\n## Step 5: Verify the script was saved\nGood! The script was saved successfully.\n\n## Step 6: Validate the script with shellcheck and bash -n\nGood! The bash syntax check passed. Shellcheck found one minor warning about an unused variable. Let me fix that:\nNow let's verify shellcheck passes:\nPerfect! Shellcheck passes with no warnings.\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nExcellent! The Docker build completed successfully. Now let's test that the installation works:\nPerfect! The installation is validated. Now let's clean up:\n## Summary\n\n\u2705 **All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Installation Details:\n\n1. **Directory Created**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/spaCy`\n\n2. **Installation Method**: **pip** (Python Package Manager)\n   - Installed spaCy version 3.8.7 using pip\n   - Version pinned to exact release: `spacy==3.8.7`\n\n3. **Prerequisites Detected and Handled**:\n   - Python 3 (required)\n   - pip3 (required)\n   - gcc/build-essential (required for compiled components)\n   - make (required)\n   - python3-dev (required for Python headers)\n\n4. **Script Features**:\n   - \u2705 Idempotent - can be run multiple times safely\n   - \u2705 Prerequisite detection and automatic installation\n   - \u2705 Version verification before and after installation\n   - \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n   - \u2705 Proper error handling\n   - \u2705 Package cache cleanup\n\n5. **Validations Passed**:\n   - \u2705 Shellcheck: No warnings or errors\n   - \u2705 Bash syntax check: Passed\n   - \u2705 Docker build: Successful\n   - \u2705 Runtime validation: spaCy 3.8.7 verified\n\n6. **Script Location**: \n   `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/spaCy/tool_setup.sh`\n\n7. **Test Results**:\n   - Installation completed in Docker successfully\n   - spaCy version 3.8.7 confirmed\n   - All prerequisites installed correctly\n   - CLI validation successful\n\n### Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"spaCy installation is moderately complex due to several factors.
