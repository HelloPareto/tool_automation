  "claude_response": "I'll install finmath-lib version finmath-lib-4.1.2 following the specifications. Let me start by analyzing the tool and creating the installation script.\n\n## Analysis\n\nBased on the provided information:\n- **Tool**: finmath-lib (Java-based mathematical finance library)\n- **Version**: finmath-lib-4.1.2\n- **Installation Method**: Binary release (though GitHub analysis shows \"No binary releases\")\n- **Prerequisites Needed**: Java (this is a Java library)\n\nSince finmath-lib is a Java library and there are no binary releases detected, I'll create a script that installs it as a Maven/Gradle dependency or downloads the JAR directly from Maven Central.\n\nLet me proceed with the installation:\nNow I'll create the installation script with proper prerequisite handling:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nGood! The script was saved correctly. Now let me validate it with shellcheck and bash syntax check:\nGood! Shellcheck found only warnings about unused variables (which are fine - they're there for documentation/future use), and bash syntax check passed. Now let's test in Docker:\nI see the issue! The `download_jar` function is using `log` which outputs to stdout, but the function is trying to capture the output with `echo`. The log messages are being captured as the filename. Let me fix this:\nNow let's validate the script again and retest in Docker:\nPerfect! The Docker build completed successfully. Now let's test the validation command:\nExcellent! Let's also test the alternative command:\nPerfect! Now let's test idempotency by running the script again:\nExcellent! The script is idempotent. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me create a final summary of the installation.\n\n## Installation Summary\n\n\u2705 **All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Installation Details\n\n**Tool**: finmath-lib  \n**Version**: finmath-lib-4.1.2  \n**Installation Method**: Binary release (JAR from Maven Central)  \n**Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/finmath-lib/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Validation Results\n\n1. \u2705 **Script Creation**: Successfully created installation script\n2. \u2705 **Shellcheck**: Passed (only minor warnings about unused variables)\n3. \u2705 **Bash Syntax**: Passed\n4. \u2705 **Docker Build**: Successful\n5. \u2705 **Version Command**: Both `finmath-lib version` and `finmath-lib --version` work correctly\n6. \u2705 **Idempotency**: Script correctly detects existing installation and skips reinstallation\n7. \u2705 **Prerequisites**: Java (OpenJDK 11) automatically detected and installed\n\n### Key Features Implemented\n\n- **Prerequisite Management**: Automatically detects and installs Java if missing\n- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times\n- **Version Pinning**: Pinned to version 4.1.2\n- **Non-Interactive**: No user prompts required\n- **Clean Logging**: Clear timestamped logs with actionable error messages\n- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation including version checks\n- **Wrapper Script**: Created user-friendly CLI wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/finmath-lib`\n\n### Installation Method Used\n\nThe script downloads the finmath-lib JAR (v4.1.2) directly from Maven Central and creates a wrapper script that:\n- Provides version information\n- Shows JAR location\n- Provides help and usage information\n- Can be used to add the library to Java application classpaths\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Status\n\n\u2705 Prerequisites detected and documented  \n\u2705 Prerequisites checked before installing  \n\u2705 Prerequisites installed automatically (Java)  \n\u2705 Prerequisites verified before tool installation  \n\u2705 Script is idempotent  \n\u2705 Version pinned (4.1.2)  \n\u2705 Non-interactive installation  \n\u2705 Uses approved repositories (Maven Central)  \n\u2705 Cache cleaned after installation  \n\u2705 Validation command works correctly  \n\u2705 Shellcheck and bash -n pass  \n\u2705 No secrets in script  \n\u2705 Clear logging with actionable messages\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"This installation has low to medium complexity.
