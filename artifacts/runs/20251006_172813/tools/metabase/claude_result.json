  "claude_response": "I'll install Metabase v0.56.8 following the specifications. Let me start by analyzing the requirements and creating the installation script.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Tool**: Metabase v0.56.8\n**Installation Method**: NPM package (though note: Metabase is typically a Java application, the npm package is a wrapper/CLI tool)\n**Prerequisites Needed**: Node.js and npm\n\nLet me proceed with the installation:\n\n## Step 1: Create Directory Structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nFor the npm package `metabase`, I need:\n- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime\n- **npm**: Node package manager\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 4: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2713 Script saved successfully!\n\n## Step 5: Validate with Shellcheck\nGood! The shellcheck warning is just informational (SC1091) - it can't follow the `/etc/os-release` file which is expected since we're not running inside the target environment. This is not an error.\n\n## Step 6: Validate Bash Syntax\n\u2713 Bash syntax check passed!\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\n**Important Discovery**: The npm package version `metabase@0.56.8` does not exist! Let me check what versions are actually available on npm:\n## Critical Issue Discovered\n\nThe npm package \"metabase\" only has version **0.1.0** (from 2015) and is NOT the actual Metabase analytics platform. The real Metabase application (v0.56.8) is a Java-based application distributed as:\n- JAR file for direct download\n- Docker image (metabase/metabase)\n- Not as an npm package\n\n**The specifications provided are incorrect** - there is no `metabase@0.56.8` npm package.\n\nLet me check if there's a different npm package name for Metabase:\nI can see that **none of these are the official Metabase server application**. The only package named `metabase` is an unrelated 2015 package with version 0.1.0.\n\n## Decision Point\n\nSince the specifications ask for `metabase v0.56.8` via npm, but this version doesn't exist on npm, I have two options:\n\n1. **Follow the spec literally** - Create a script that tries to install a non-existent version (will fail)\n2. **Use the Docker method** - Since Docker was listed as a detected method and v0.56.8 exists as a Docker image\n\nGiven that the user specified npm explicitly and provided a validation command (`npm list -g metabase`), I'll create a script that documents this issue but follows the spec. However, I'll add helpful error messaging explaining the situation.\n\nLet me update the script to handle this edge case better:\nGood! Now let's re-validate the script:\n\u2713 Both checks pass! Now let's test the improved script in Docker:\nPerfect! The script now provides clear, actionable diagnostic information about why the installation fails. Let's clean up the test environment:\n## Summary\n\n### Installation Script Status: \u2705 **COMPLETED WITH CRITICAL FINDINGS**\n\n**Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/metabase/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Key Results:\n\n\u2705 **Script Creation**: Successfully created idempotent installation script  \n\u2705 **Shellcheck**: Passed (only SC1091 info message - expected)  \n\u2705 **Bash Syntax**: Passed  \n\u2705 **Prerequisites**: Properly detects and installs Node.js 18.x and npm  \n\u2705 **Verification**: All prerequisites verified before tool installation  \n\u2705 **Standards Compliance**: Follows all installation standards  \n\u274c **Docker Test**: Script correctly fails with diagnostic information\n\n### Critical Finding:\n\n**The specified package `metabase@0.56.8` DOES NOT EXIST on npm registry.**\n\nThe npm package named \"metabase\" only has version **0.1.0** (published in 2015) and is completely unrelated to the official Metabase analytics platform.\n\n**The official Metabase v0.56.8** is a Java-based business intelligence application distributed via:\n- **Docker**: `docker pull metabase/metabase:v0.56.8`\n- **JAR file**: https://downloads.metabase.com/v0.56.8/metabase.jar\n- **Cloud**: https://www.metabase.com/start/\n\n### Script Features:\n\n1. \u2705 **Prerequisite Management**:\n   - Checks for Node.js and npm\n   - Installs Node.js 18.x from official NodeSource repository\n   - Verifies prerequisites before proceeding\n\n2. \u2705 **Idempotency**: Script can be run multiple times safely\n\n3. \u2705 **Version Pinning**: Targets specific versions (Node.js 18.x, metabase 0.56.8)\n\n4. \u2705 **Comprehensive Error Handling**:\n   - Detects non-existent npm packages\n   - Provides diagnostic information\n   - Suggests alternative installation methods\n\n5. \u2705 **Clear Logging**: Timestamped logs with actionable error messages\n\n6. \u2705 **Standards Compliance**:\n   - Non-interactive installation\n   - Proper GPG key management\n   - Cache cleanup\n   - Clear validation function\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Status:\n\n| Criterion | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Prerequisites detected | \u2705 | Node.js and npm identified |\n| Prerequisites checked | \u2705 | `check_prerequisites()` function |\n| Prerequisites installed | \u2705 | Installs Node.js 18.x via NodeSource |\n| Prerequisites verified | \u2705 | Version checks for node and npm |\n| Idempotent | \u2705 | Multiple runs safe |\n| Version pinned | \u2705 | Pinned to v0.56.8 |\n| Non-interactive | \u2705 | Uses DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive |\n| Approved repos | \u2705 | Uses NodeSource official repo |\n| Cache cleaned | \u2705 | Cleans apt cache |\n| Validation works | \u26a0\ufe0f | Cannot validate non-existent package |\n| Shellcheck passes | \u2705 | Only SC1091 info (expected) |\n| No secrets | \u2705 | No embedded credentials |\n| Clear logging | \u2705 | Comprehensive error messages |\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nThe specifications provided are **incorrect**. To actually install Metabase v0.56.8, the installation method should be changed to:\n- **Docker** (recommended): Use the `metabase/metabase:v0.56.8` image\n- **JAR Download**: Download and run the Java JAR file\n- **Not npm**: The npm package manager is not a valid distribution method for this tool\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"This installation has medium-low complexity.
