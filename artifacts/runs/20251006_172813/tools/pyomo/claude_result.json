  "claude_response": "I'll install pyomo version 6.9.4 following the specifications. Let me start by creating the directory structure and then generating the installation script.\nNow I'll generate a complete installation script with proper prerequisite handling for pyomo 6.9.4:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nGood! The script was saved correctly. Now let me validate it with shellcheck and bash syntax check:\nPerfect! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed without errors. Now let me test the script in a Docker container:\nI see the issue! The validation command uses `python` but the system only has `python3`. Let me fix the script:\nGood! Now let me update the comment at the top too to reflect the correct command:\nNow let me re-validate with shellcheck and test again in Docker:\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded. Now let me run the validation command in the container:\nPerfect! The validation command returned 6.9.4 as expected. Now let me clean up:\nPerfect! Now let me verify the final script one more time:\n## Summary\n\n\u2705 **Installation Completed Successfully!**\n\n### What Was Done:\n\n1. **Directory Created**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/pyomo/`\n\n2. **Installation Script Generated**: `tool_setup.sh` with the following features:\n   - **Prerequisites Detected**: Python3 and pip3\n   - **Prerequisite Handling**: Automatic detection, installation, and verification\n   - **Installation Method**: pip install (binary_release from PyPI)\n   - **Version Pinned**: pyomo==6.9.4\n   - **Idempotency**: Script checks if tool is already installed and skips if version matches\n   - **Validation**: Uses `python3 -c 'import pyomo; print(pyomo.__version__)'`\n   - **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with troubleshooting steps\n   - **Logging**: Timestamped, color-coded logging\n\n3. **Validation Passed**:\n   - \u2705 Shellcheck: No issues found\n   - \u2705 Bash syntax check: Passed\n   - \u2705 Docker build: Successful\n   - \u2705 Docker validation: Returns correct version (6.9.4)\n\n4. **Script Location**: \n   `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/pyomo/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Installation Method Used:\n**pip install** - Pyomo is a Python package distributed via PyPI. The script uses pip3 to install the exact version 6.9.4. While binary releases are available on GitHub, pip is the recommended and most straightforward installation method for Python packages.\n\n### Acceptance Checklist Status:\n- \u2705 Prerequisites detected and documented\n- \u2705 Prerequisites checked before installing\n- \u2705 Missing prerequisites installed automatically\n- \u2705 Prerequisites verified before tool installation\n- \u2705 Script is idempotent\n- \u2705 Version pinned (6.9.4)\n- \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n- \u2705 Uses approved repos and locations\n- \u2705 Cleans caches after installation\n- \u2705 Validation works and returns expected version\n- \u2705 Shellcheck and bash -n pass\n- \u2705 No secrets in script\n- \u2705 Clear logging with actionable error messages\n\n---\n\n### Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Pyomo 6.9.4 installation is straightforward with low complexity.
