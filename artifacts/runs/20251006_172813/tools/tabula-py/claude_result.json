  "claude_response": "I'll install tabula-py v2.10.0 following all the specifications. Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Create Directory Structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nBased on the documentation and tool analysis:\n- **Primary Prerequisite**: Python 3 (with pip)\n- **Additional Prerequisite**: Java Runtime Environment (explicitly mentioned in docs: \"Ensure you have a Java runtime and set the PATH for it\")\n- **Installation Method**: pip package manager\n- **Special Note**: The validate command uses `tabula_py` (underscore) while the package is `tabula-py` (hyphen)\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 4: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2713 Script saved successfully!\n\n## Step 5: Validate with Shellcheck\nThe shellcheck warning is minor (unused variable), but let me fix it to pass cleanly:\nNow let's rerun shellcheck and bash syntax check:\n\u2713 **Shellcheck passed with no errors!**\n\u2713 **Bash syntax check passed!**\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\nExcellent! The Docker build completed successfully. Now let's test the validation command:\nPerfect! The validation passed - it correctly reports version 2.10.0. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me also verify the script runs idempotently (can be run twice):\nPerfect! The idempotency test shows:\n1. **First run**: Installs all prerequisites and tabula-py\n2. **Second run**: Detects existing installation and validates it successfully\n\nLet's clean up the idempotency test:\nPerfect! All tests passed successfully. Let me create the final summary.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf89 Installation Complete - Summary Report\n\n### \u2705 All Steps Completed Successfully\n\n**Tool**: tabula-py v2.10.0  \n**Installation Method**: pip (Python Package Manager)  \n**Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/tabula-py/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Prerequisites Detected and Installed:\n1. **Python 3** - Required for pip package installation\n2. **pip3** - Python package manager\n3. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** - Required by tabula-py (uses Apache Tika's Tabula-java)\n\n### Validation Results:\n\n#### \u2705 Shellcheck: PASSED\n- No errors or warnings\n\n#### \u2705 Bash Syntax Check: PASSED\n- Script syntax is valid\n\n#### \u2705 Docker Build Test: PASSED\n- Successfully installed all prerequisites\n- Successfully installed tabula-py 2.10.0\n- Validation command confirms version: `2.10.0`\n\n#### \u2705 Idempotency Test: PASSED\n- First run: Complete installation\n- Second run: Detected existing installation, validated and exited successfully\n- No errors on repeated execution\n\n### Script Features:\n\u2705 **Complete prerequisite detection** - Checks for Python, pip, and Java  \n\u2705 **Automatic prerequisite installation** - Installs missing dependencies  \n\u2705 **Prerequisite verification** - Confirms each prerequisite works before proceeding  \n\u2705 **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times  \n\u2705 **Version pinned** - Exact version 2.10.0  \n\u2705 **Non-interactive** - Runs without user prompts  \n\u2705 **Clear logging** - Timestamped logs with descriptive messages  \n\u2705 **Error handling** - Uses `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling  \n\u2705 **Clean apt cache** - Minimizes image size impact  \n\u2705 **Proper validation** - Confirms correct version is installed  \n\n### Acceptance Checklist Status:\n- [x] Prerequisites detected\n- [x] Prerequisites checked before installing\n- [x] Prerequisites installed automatically\n- [x] Prerequisites verified before tool installation\n- [x] Idempotent (re-run = no changes, exits 0)\n- [x] Version pinned (2.10.0)\n- [x] Non-interactive install\n- [x] Approved repos and locations\n- [x] Cache cleaned\n- [x] Validation works (returns version 2.10.0)\n- [x] Shellcheck passes\n- [x] No secrets in script\n- [x] Clear logging with timestamps\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"tabula-py presents low-to-medium complexity due to its dual prerequisites.
