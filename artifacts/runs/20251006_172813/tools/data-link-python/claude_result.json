  "claude_response": "I'll install data-link-python following the specifications. Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Detect Prerequisites\n\nBased on the tool analysis:\n- **Primary prerequisite**: Python 3 and pip3\n- **Package manager**: pip\n- **Package name**: nasdaq-data-link\n- **Installation method**: Simple pip install\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n\nNow I'll create a complete installation script with prerequisite handling:\n## Step 4: Verify the Script was Saved\nGood! The script was saved successfully. Now let me validate it.\n\n## Step 5: Validate with Shellcheck and Bash Syntax\nPerfect! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed without errors.\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\n\nNow let me create a Docker test environment:\nI see the issue! The available versions on PyPI are only 1.0.0-1.0.4, not 3.0.9. Let me check the actual latest version available:\nThe latest version is 1.0.4, not 3.0.9. Let me also check if there's a different package name or if the validation command needs adjustment:\nLet me check PyPI using WebSearch to find the correct version:\nGood! The latest version is 1.0.4. Now let me update the script with the correct version:\nAlso need to update the header comment:\nNow let me test it again with the correct version. First, let me copy the updated script:\nGood progress! The package installed successfully, but the validation command has an issue - the module doesn't have a `__version__` attribute. Let me check what attributes it does have:\nLet me install it locally first to test:\nPerfect! The version is accessed via `nasdaqdatalink.version.VERSION`, not `nasdaqdatalink.__version__`. Let me update the validation function:\nNow let me validate the script syntax again and rebuild the Docker image:\nGood! Now copy and rebuild:\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded! Now let me test running the validation command:\nPerfect! Now let me test idempotency by running the script again:\nPerfect! The script is idempotent - it detects that the tool is already installed and exits successfully. Now let me clean up:\nExcellent! Now let me verify the final script one more time:\nPerfect! Let me create a comprehensive summary.\n\n---\n\n## Installation Complete! \u2705\n\n### Summary\n\nI have successfully created and tested the installation script for **data-link-python (Nasdaq Data Link)**.\n\n### What Was Done\n\n1. **Directory Created**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/data-link-python/`\n\n2. **Script Generated**: `tool_setup.sh` with complete prerequisite handling:\n   - \u2705 **check_prerequisites()** - Detects Python 3 and pip3\n   - \u2705 **install_prerequisites()** - Installs missing Python/pip\n   - \u2705 **verify_prerequisites()** - Verifies installations work\n   - \u2705 **check_existing_installation()** - Checks for existing package\n   - \u2705 **install_tool()** - Installs nasdaq-data-link via pip\n   - \u2705 **validate()** - Validates installation using `nasdaqdatalink.version.VERSION`\n\n3. **Validations Passed**:\n   - \u2705 shellcheck -x (no errors)\n   - \u2705 bash -n (syntax check passed)\n\n4. **Docker Testing Completed**:\n   - \u2705 Built successfully in Ubuntu 22.04 container\n   - \u2705 Installation succeeded\n   - \u2705 Validation command works: `python3 -c \"import nasdaqdatalink; print(nasdaqdatalink.version.VERSION)\"` returns `1.0.4`\n   - \u2705 Idempotency verified (re-running script detects existing installation)\n\n### Installation Method Used\n\n**Package Manager: pip**\n- Package: `nasdaq-data-link`\n- Version pinned: `1.0.4` (latest available on PyPI)\n- Prerequisites: Python 3, pip3\n\n### Key Features\n\n- \u2705 **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times\n- \u2705 **Version Pinned**: Uses exact version 1.0.4\n- \u2705 **Non-Interactive**: Fully automated\n- \u2705 **Prerequisite Detection**: Checks for Python/pip before installing\n- \u2705 **Clear Logging**: Timestamped, color-coded output\n- \u2705 **Error Handling**: Actionable error messages\n- \u2705 **Cache Cleanup**: Removes apt cache after installation\n\n### Script Location\n\n```\n/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/data-link-python/tool_setup.sh\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- The original validation command had an incorrect import statement. I corrected it from `nasdaqdatalink.__version__` to `nasdaqdatalink.version.VERSION` based on testing\n- Version 1.0.4 is the latest available on PyPI (as of testing)\n- The script automatically detects and installs Python 3 and pip3 as prerequisites on Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS systems\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"This is a straightforward Python package installation with minimal complexity.
