  "claude_response": "I'll install FinancePy version V0.360 following all the specifications. Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nFor FinancePy (a Python package):\n- **Primary prerequisite**: Python 3 (python3, pip3)\n- **Installation method**: pip (Python package manager)\n- **Dependencies**: Will be handled by pip automatically\n\n## Step 3: Generate the Installation Script\n## Step 4: Verify the script was saved\n\u2705 Script saved successfully!\n\n## Step 5: Validate the script with shellcheck and bash syntax check\n\u2705 **Shellcheck passed** - No issues found!  \n\u2705 **Bash syntax check passed** - No syntax errors!\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\nI see the issue! FinancePy prints a banner message to stdout when imported, which interferes with the version validation. The installation actually succeeded (we can see \"financepy-0.360\" was installed), but the validation command returns the banner instead of just the version. Let me fix the script to handle this:\nNow let me validate the updated script again:\nThe VALIDATE_CMD is now unused since we changed the validation logic. Let me remove it:\n\u2705 Shellcheck passed! Now let's test the updated script in Docker:\nI see the issue - the grep with `-P` (Perl regex) might not be working as expected. Let me test what FinancePy actually returns and adjust the validation logic:\nLet me use a simpler approach - redirect stderr and get the last line only:\n\u2705 Shellcheck passed! Now let's test again:\nThe banner is still being printed to stdout, not stderr. Let me check what's actually being output by running a quick test to see where the banner goes:\nFinancePy isn't installed locally. The key insight is that the banner is being output to stdout along with the version. Let me try a completely different approach - use pip show to verify the version instead:\nPerfect! Now let's test in Docker:\n\ud83c\udf89 **Excellent! The Docker build succeeded!** The validation passed with the message: \"Validation successful: FinancePy version 0.360 is correctly installed\"\n\nNow let's run the final validation command in the container:\nPerfect! \u2705 Version 0.360 is correctly installed. Now let's test idempotency by running the script again:\nPerfect! The script is idempotent - it detected the existing installation and completed successfully. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me verify the final script one more time:\nExcellent! Now let me create the final summary report:\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 Installation Complete: FinancePy V0.360\n\n## Summary\n\nSuccessfully created and tested the installation script for **FinancePy V0.360**. All validation steps passed successfully.\n\n## Installation Details\n\n- **Tool Name**: FinancePy\n- **Version**: V0.360 (PyPI: 0.360)\n- **Installation Method**: pip (Python Package Manager)\n- **Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/FinancePy/tool_setup.sh`\n\n## Prerequisites Handled\n\nThe script automatically detects and installs:\n1. **Python 3** (python3.10 on Ubuntu 22.04)\n2. **pip3** (Python package manager)\n3. **python3-venv** (virtual environment support)\n\n## Validation Results\n\n### \u2705 Shellcheck: PASSED\nNo issues found in static analysis\n\n### \u2705 Bash Syntax Check: PASSED\nNo syntax errors detected\n\n### \u2705 Docker Build: PASSED\nSuccessfully built and installed in Ubuntu 22.04 container\n\n### \u2705 Version Validation: PASSED\nConfirmed version 0.360 installed correctly\n\n### \u2705 Idempotency Test: PASSED\nScript can be run multiple times safely - detects existing installation and validates without reinstalling\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Prerequisite Management**: Automatically detects and installs Python 3 and pip if missing\n2. **Version Pinning**: Installs exact version 0.360 as specified\n3. **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times\n4. **Non-Interactive**: Fully automated installation\n5. **Proper Validation**: Uses `pip show` to verify version (avoiding FinancePy's banner output)\n6. **Clean Logging**: Timestamped logs with clear success/error messages\n7. **Error Handling**: Uses `set -euo pipefail` for robust error detection\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nFinancePy prints a banner message to stdout when imported, which initially interfered with version validation. The script uses `pip show` instead of importing the module to reliably verify the version.\n\n## Acceptance Checklist Status\n\n\u2705 Prerequisites detected and documented  \n\u2705 Prerequisites checked before installing  \n\u2705 Missing prerequisites installed automatically  \n\u2705 Prerequisites verified before tool installation  \n\u2705 Script is idempotent  \n\u2705 Version pinned (0.360)  \n\u2705 Non-interactive installation  \n\u2705 Approved repos (PyPI via pip)  \n\u2705 Cache cleaned after installation  \n\u2705 Validation returns expected version  \n\u2705 Shellcheck and bash -n passed  \n\u2705 No secrets in script  \n\u2705 Clear logging with actionable messages  \n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"FinancePy installation is straightforward as a pure Python package available on PyPI.
