  "claude_response": "I'll install pyam v3.1.0 following the specifications. Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nFor pyam v3.1.0:\n- **Primary prerequisite**: Python 3 (Python package)\n- **Package manager**: pip3\n- **Installation method**: pip install with version pinning\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 4: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2713 Script saved successfully\n\n## Step 5: Validate with shellcheck and bash -n\n\u2713 shellcheck passed with no issues\n\u2713 bash syntax check passed\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\nI see the issue! The validation command uses `python` instead of `python3`. The pyam package installs successfully, but the validation fails because it calls `python` which doesn't exist. Let me fix this:\nGood! Now let me re-run the validation tests:\n\u2713 shellcheck and bash syntax still pass\n\nNow let's rebuild the Docker test:\nGreat progress! The installation script worked perfectly - pyam v3.1.0 was successfully installed and validated. The only issue is in the Dockerfile verification line which uses `python` instead of `python3`. Let me fix that:\nNow let's rebuild and test:\nPerfect! \u2713 Docker build successful! The verification shows pyam version 3.1.0 is correctly installed.\n\nNow let's run the validation command and clean up:\nPerfect! \u2713 Container validation successful - pyam 3.1.0 is working correctly.\n\nNow let's clean up:\nExcellent! \u2713 Cleanup completed successfully.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Installation Summary\n\n### \u2705 All Steps Completed Successfully\n\n**Tool:** pyam v3.1.0  \n**Installation Method:** pip (Python package manager)  \n**Script Location:** `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/pyam/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Installation Details:\n\n1. \u2705 **Directory Created**: Installation directory structure created successfully\n2. \u2705 **Script Generated**: Complete idempotent installation script with comprehensive prerequisite handling\n3. \u2705 **Script Saved**: Saved to correct location and verified\n4. \u2705 **Shellcheck Passed**: No issues found in static analysis\n5. \u2705 **Bash Syntax Passed**: Syntax validation successful\n6. \u2705 **Docker Test Passed**: Successfully built and tested in Ubuntu 22.04 container\n7. \u2705 **Validation Passed**: pyam v3.1.0 imports correctly and reports correct version\n8. \u2705 **Cleanup Complete**: Docker artifacts removed\n\n### Script Features:\n\n\u2713 **Prerequisite Management**: Detects and installs Python 3 and pip3 automatically  \n\u2713 **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times - checks existing installation first  \n\u2713 **Version Pinned**: Installs exactly pyam-iamc==3.1.0  \n\u2713 **Non-Interactive**: Uses DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive  \n\u2713 **Error Handling**: Uses `set -euo pipefail` for safety  \n\u2713 **Clear Logging**: Timestamped logs with actionable error messages  \n\u2713 **Cache Cleanup**: Removes apt cache after installation  \n\u2713 **Comprehensive Validation**: Verifies both prerequisites and tool installation\n\n### Key Prerequisites:\n- Python 3.10.12 (or compatible)\n- pip3 22.0.2 (or compatible)\n\n### Validation Command:\n```bash\npython3 -c 'import pyam; print(pyam.__version__)'\n```\n**Expected Output:** `3.1.0`\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"pyam v3.1.0 is a straightforward Python package installation with low complexity.
