  "claude_response": "I'll install quarto-cl version latest following the specifications. Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Create Directory Structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nBased on the tool details:\n- **Tool**: quarto-cl (Python package: quarto_cli)\n- **Package Manager**: pip\n- **Prerequisites**: \n  1. Python 3 (required for pip package)\n  2. pip (Python package installer)\n  3. python3-venv (recommended for virtual environments)\n\n## Step 3: Choose Installation Method\n\nThe tool is a Python package available via pip, so I'll use **pip install** method with version pinning.\n\n## Step 4: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 5: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2713 Script saved successfully!\n\n## Step 6: Validate the Script\nGood! The shellcheck warning (SC1091) is informational only - it can't follow the `/etc/os-release` file because it doesn't exist on macOS, but this is expected as the script is designed for Linux. The bash syntax check passed with no errors.\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nI see the issue! The script is incorrectly picking up the OS version (\"22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\") instead of using \"latest\". This is coming from the VERSION variable being used in an error message. Let me fix this bug:\nWait, I see the issue more clearly now. The problem is that when running `lsb_release -d` or similar, it's capturing the Ubuntu version string. Let me check where the VERSION variable is being contaminated. Looking at the error message log line more carefully:\nI found it! On line 196, it logs \"Installing $TOOL_NAME version $VERSION...\" - and when VERSION=\"latest\", this is correct. But in the error log, it said \"Installing quarto_cli version 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)...\" which means the VERSION variable was somehow overwritten. Let me check the install_prerequisites function:\nFound it! Line 78 sources `/etc/os-release` which contains many variables including `VERSION`, which overwrites our global VERSION variable. I need to use local variables for OS detection:\nPerfect! Now let's re-run the validation and Docker tests:\nExcellent! Both shellcheck and bash syntax check passed cleanly. Now let's update the Docker test:\nGood progress! The package installed successfully (quarto_cli-1.8.25), but the validation failed. Let me check what the validation error is:\nThe test timed out. Let me investigate the package more carefully. Let me check if there's a `__version__` attribute in the quarto_cli package:\nLet me investigate the GitHub repository directly:\nLet me check the source code structure:\nLet me search for the actual validation command that works with this package:\nBased on the search results, it's clear that `quarto_cli` Python package doesn't have a `__version__` attribute. The proper way to validate the installation is to use the `quarto` command-line tool. Let me update the validation command:\nNow I also need to update the validation function to check if the quarto command is available:\nI also need to update the check_existing_installation function to use the quarto command instead of trying to import the version:\nNow let's validate the updated script and test it:\nGreat! Now let's update the test directory and run Docker test again:\nNow I need to update the Dockerfile to use the correct validation command:\nGreat! The Docker build completed successfully! Let's now test the validation command:\nPerfect! Now let's clean up:\nExcellent! Let's verify the final script one more time:\nPerfect! Let me create a summary of the installation.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Installation Complete - Summary Report\n\n### Installation Details\n- **Tool Name**: quarto-cl\n- **Version**: latest (1.8.25 installed during testing)\n- **Package**: quarto_cli (Python package)\n- **Installation Method**: pip (Python Package Manager)\n- **Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/quarto-cl/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Prerequisites Detected & Handled\n1. **Python 3** - Required for pip package installation\n2. **pip3** - Python package installer\n3. **python3-venv** - Virtual environment support\n\n### Validation Status\n\u2705 **All checks passed:**\n- \u2705 Shellcheck validation: Clean (no errors)\n- \u2705 Bash syntax check: Clean\n- \u2705 Docker build test: Successful\n- \u2705 Installation validation: Successful (quarto --version returns 1.8.25)\n- \u2705 Idempotency: Confirmed (script can be run multiple times safely)\n\n### Key Features Implemented\n1. **Prerequisite Detection**: Automatically checks for Python 3 and pip3\n2. **Prerequisite Installation**: Installs missing prerequisites based on OS (Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/RHEL, Alpine)\n3. **Prerequisite Verification**: Validates that prerequisites work before proceeding\n4. **Idempotency**: Safe to run multiple times - detects existing installations\n5. **Version Validation**: Uses `quarto --version` command to verify installation\n6. **Multi-OS Support**: Supports Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat-based systems, and Alpine Linux\n7. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with proper exit codes\n8. **Logging**: Timestamped logs for all major operations\n9. **Cache Cleanup**: Cleans apt caches to minimize image size\n\n### Notable Implementation Details\n- **Bug Fixed**: Initially the script had a namespace pollution issue where sourcing `/etc/os-release` overwrote the VERSION variable. This was fixed by using `grep` to extract only the OS ID.\n- **Validation Method**: The package doesn't expose a `__version__` attribute, so validation uses the `quarto --version` CLI command instead.\n- **Package Type**: The `quarto_cli` pip package downloads and installs the actual Quarto CLI binaries from GitHub during installation.\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**pip** - The quarto_cli package is available on PyPI and includes all necessary dependencies (Jupyter, nbclient, and related packages).\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The quarto-cl installation has low to medium complexity.
