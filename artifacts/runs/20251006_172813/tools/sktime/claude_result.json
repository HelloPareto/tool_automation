  "claude_response": "I'll install sktime v0.39.0 following the specifications. Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Ensure directory exists\n## Step 2: Prerequisite Analysis\n\nFor sktime v0.39.0 (Python package):\n- **Primary prerequisite**: Python 3 (with pip)\n- **Installation method**: pip install\n- **Dependencies**: Will be handled automatically by pip\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 5: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2713 Script saved successfully\n\n## Step 6: Validate the Script\n\u2713 Shellcheck passed with no issues\n\u2713 Bash syntax validation passed\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nI see the issue - the validation command uses `python` but only `python3` is installed. Let me fix this:\nNow let me re-validate the script and test again:\nThe build timed out due to slow network. Let me try running the validation directly on a successfully built container. Let me check if the container was actually built:\nLet me try a simplified Docker test that focuses on just the script execution without the full base image overhead:\nThe Docker build is running. Let me wait for it to complete in the background and check on it periodically. Let me allow more time:\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded! Now let me verify the installation and clean up:\nPerfect! Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me verify the final script one more time:\n## Summary\n\n\u2705 **Installation completed successfully!**\n\n### Results:\n\n1. **\u2705 Directory Created**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/sktime/`\n\n2. **\u2705 Script Generated**: Complete installation script saved to `tool_setup.sh` with:\n   - **Prerequisite detection**: Checks for Python3 and pip3\n   - **Prerequisite installation**: Installs Python3 and pip3 if missing\n   - **Prerequisite verification**: Verifies Python3 and pip3 work correctly\n   - **Idempotency**: Checks if sktime is already installed before proceeding\n   - **Version pinning**: Installs exactly version 0.39.0\n   - **Proper validation**: Uses `python3 -c 'import sktime; print(sktime.__version__)'`\n\n3. **\u2705 Script Validation**:\n   - Shellcheck: Passed with no issues\n   - Bash syntax check: Passed\n\n4. **\u2705 Docker Testing**:\n   - Built successfully in Ubuntu 22.04 container\n   - All prerequisites installed correctly\n   - sktime v0.39.0 installed successfully\n   - Validation confirmed: `0.39.0`\n\n5. **\u2705 Installation Method**: **pip install** (Python package manager)\n   - Most appropriate method for Python packages\n   - Clean, straightforward installation\n   - Automatic dependency resolution\n\n### Key Features of the Script:\n\n- **Prerequisites managed**: Python3 and pip3 automatically detected and installed if missing\n- **Idempotent**: Can be run multiple times safely\n- **Non-interactive**: No prompts during installation\n- **Proper logging**: Clear timestamps and error messages\n- **Cache cleanup**: Removes apt cache after installation\n- **Validation**: Confirms correct version installed\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"sktime v0.39.0 installation is very straightforward.
