  "claude_response": "I'll install pandera v0.26.1 following the specifications. Let me start by creating the directory structure and analyzing the requirements.\nNow, let me analyze the requirements and generate the installation script:\n\n**Prerequisites Analysis:**\n- **Python 3**: Required for pip and running pandera\n- **pip**: Required for installing Python packages\n- No build tools needed (pandera is a pure Python package)\n\n**Installation Method:** pip (Python package manager)\n\nLet me create the comprehensive installation script:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nGood! The script is saved. Now let me validate it with shellcheck and bash syntax check:\nExcellent! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed without errors. Now let's test the script in Docker:\nNow let's build the Docker image:\nPerfect! The Docker build succeeded. Let's run a final validation test:\nExcellent! The validation succeeded - pandera v0.26.1 is installed and working correctly. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me now verify the final script location:\n## Summary\n\n\u2705 **All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Installation Details:\n- **Tool:** pandera v0.26.1\n- **Installation Method:** pip (Python package manager)\n- **Script Location:** `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/pandera/tool_setup.sh`\n- **Script Size:** 6.4 KB\n\n### Prerequisites Handled:\n1. \u2705 **Python 3** - Detected and installed if missing\n2. \u2705 **pip3** - Detected and installed if missing\n\n### Validation Results:\n1. \u2705 **Shellcheck:** Passed with no errors or warnings\n2. \u2705 **Bash Syntax Check:** Passed\n3. \u2705 **Docker Build:** Successful\n4. \u2705 **Docker Runtime Test:** pandera v0.26.1 installed and validated correctly\n5. \u2705 **Idempotency:** Script checks for existing installation before proceeding\n6. \u2705 **Version Pinning:** Exact version 0.26.1 specified\n7. \u2705 **Prerequisites:** Automatically detected, installed, and verified\n\n### Key Features of the Script:\n- **Prerequisite Management:** Automatically detects and installs Python 3 and pip3\n- **Idempotent:** Can be run multiple times safely\n- **Non-Interactive:** Uses `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`\n- **Version Validation:** Ensures exact version 0.26.1 is installed\n- **Clear Logging:** Timestamped logs with actionable error messages\n- **Clean Exit Codes:** Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure\n- **Cache Cleanup:** Removes apt cache after installation\n\n### Test Results:\n- Installation script executed successfully in Docker\n- Validation command confirmed version 0.26.1\n- All prerequisites were automatically installed\n- Clean installation with no errors\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Pandera is a straightforward Python package installation with minimal complexity.
