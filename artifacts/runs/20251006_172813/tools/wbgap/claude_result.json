  "claude_response": "I'll install wbgap following the specifications. Let me start by creating the directory structure and analyzing the requirements.\nNow let me analyze the tool requirements:\n\n**PREREQUISITE ANALYSIS:**\n- **Tool Type**: Python package (wbgapi)\n- **Package Manager**: pip\n- **Prerequisites Required**: \n  1. Python 3 (programming language runtime)\n  2. pip3 (Python package manager)\n- **Installation Method**: pip install (simple package manager installation)\n\nLet me check PyPI for the latest version information:\nPerfect! The latest version is 1.0.12. Now I'll generate a complete installation script with proper prerequisite handling:\nNow let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nGood! Script is saved. Now let's validate it with shellcheck:\nExcellent! Shellcheck passed. Now let's verify bash syntax:\nPerfect! Bash syntax check passed. Now let's test in Docker. First, create the test directory:\nNow create the Dockerfile:\nNow copy the installation script to the test directory:\nNow build the Docker image:\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded. Now let's run the validation command in the container:\nPerfect! The validation passed. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! All steps completed successfully. Let me verify the final script location:\n## Installation Summary\n\n\u2705 **All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Installation Details:\n- **Tool**: wbgap (World Bank Group API Python library)\n- **Version**: 1.0.12 (latest version pinned from PyPI)\n- **Installation Method**: pip (Python package manager)\n- **Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/wbgap/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Prerequisites Handled:\n1. **Python 3** (3.10.12) - Detected and installed via apt-get\n2. **pip3** (22.0.2) - Installed along with python3-pip package\n3. **python3-venv** - Installed for virtual environment support\n\n### Script Features:\n\u2705 **Idempotent** - Can be run multiple times safely  \n\u2705 **Version Pinned** - Uses exact version 1.0.12  \n\u2705 **Non-Interactive** - Uses DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive  \n\u2705 **Prerequisite Detection** - Checks for Python/pip before installing  \n\u2705 **Prerequisite Installation** - Installs missing prerequisites automatically  \n\u2705 **Prerequisite Verification** - Verifies prerequisites work before proceeding  \n\u2705 **Cache Cleanup** - Cleans apt cache after installation  \n\u2705 **Validation** - Confirms installation with version check  \n\u2705 **Clear Logging** - Timestamped logs with actionable error messages  \n\u2705 **Security** - No embedded secrets or credentials  \n\n### Validation Results:\n\u2705 **Shellcheck**: Passed with no warnings or errors  \n\u2705 **Bash Syntax**: Passed (bash -n)  \n\u2705 **Docker Build**: Successful - Built from Ubuntu 22.04 base  \n\u2705 **Docker Runtime**: Validation command returned correct version: `1.0.12`  \n\u2705 **Idempotency Test**: Script correctly detected existing installation during build  \n\n### Installation Flow:\n1. \u2705 Check prerequisites (Python3, pip3)\n2. \u2705 Install missing prerequisites via apt-get\n3. \u2705 Verify prerequisites work correctly\n4. \u2705 Check if tool already installed (idempotency)\n5. \u2705 Install wbgapi==1.0.12 via pip3\n6. \u2705 Validate installation with version check\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"This is a very straightforward Python package installation with minimal complexity.
