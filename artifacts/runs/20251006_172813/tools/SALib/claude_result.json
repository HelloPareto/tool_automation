  "claude_response": "I'll install SALib v1.4.7 following the specifications. Let me start by creating the directory structure and analyzing the prerequisites.\nGood! Now let me analyze the tool and generate the installation script.\n\n**Prerequisites Analysis for SALib:**\n- **Python 3**: SALib is a Python package, requires Python 3 and pip\n- **pip**: Python package installer\n- **Build tools**: May be needed for numpy/scipy compilation (common Python scientific dependencies)\n\nNow I'll generate a complete installation script with proper prerequisite handling:\nGreat! Now let me verify the script was saved correctly:\nPerfect! The script is saved correctly. Now let me validate it with shellcheck and bash syntax check:\nGood! Shellcheck shows only an informational message (SC1091) about not following the /etc/os-release file, which is expected since it's a system file that won't exist during static analysis. The bash syntax check passed without errors.\n\nNow let's test the script in Docker:\nNow let's build the Docker image:\nThe build is taking longer than expected due to downloading large dependencies like numpy and pandas. Let me check if there are any background Docker processes running and try with a longer timeout or check the build progress:\nThe image wasn't created because the build timed out. Let me retry with a much longer timeout since pip is downloading large scientific packages (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib):\nInteresting! The package installed successfully, but the validation failed. The issue is that SALib installed the package as `salib` (lowercase) but we're trying to import it as `salib`. Let me check what the actual import name should be. Looking at the error, it seems the import is failing. Let me check the validation command more carefully - the issue might be with how we're importing. Let me test directly:\nLet me check the SALib GitHub repository to understand the correct import method. The issue is that the package name is `salib` (lowercase) but the actual Python module might be `SALib` (with capital letters). Let me fix the script:\nThe issue is clear - the Python package `SALib` should be imported with capital letters as `SALib`, not `salib`. Let me fix the script:\nWait, I also need to fix the pip install command. The pip package name is lowercase `salib`, but the Python import uses uppercase `SALib`. Let me fix this properly:\nNow let me update the install function to use the correct pip package name:\nI see the issue - I need to update the install_tool function to use PIP_PACKAGE_NAME. Actually, let me check PyPI first to see what the actual package name is:\nGood! The PyPI package name is `SALib` (with capitals), not `salib`. The script is now correct. Let me update the script to remove the redundant variable:\nPerfect! Now let's validate the updated script and test it again:\nGood! Now let's update the Docker test files and run the test again:\nExcellent! The Docker build was successful! Now let's run the validation command in the Docker container and then clean up:\nPerfect! The validation command works correctly. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Let me verify the final script location one more time:\nExcellent! All steps completed successfully. Let me provide a comprehensive summary:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 SALib v1.4.7 Installation - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY\n\n### Summary\n\nI have successfully created and tested an idempotent installation script for SALib v1.4.7 following all Solutions Team Install Standards.\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**pip (Python Package Manager)**\n\n### Steps Completed\n\n1. \u2705 **Directory Structure Created**\n   - Created: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/SALib/`\n\n2. \u2705 **Script Generated** (7.8KB)\n   - Location: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/SALib/tool_setup.sh`\n   - Includes proper prerequisite detection and installation (Python 3, pip3, build-essential, python3-dev)\n   - Fully idempotent - can be run multiple times safely\n   - Version pinned to 1.4.7\n   - Clear logging with timestamps\n\n3. \u2705 **Script Validation**\n   - Shellcheck: Passed (only informational SC1091 about /etc/os-release)\n   - Bash syntax check: Passed\n\n4. \u2705 **Docker Testing**\n   - Built Docker image successfully\n   - Script installed SALib v1.4.7 and all dependencies (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, etc.)\n   - Validation command confirmed: `1.4.7`\n   - Cleaned up test artifacts\n\n### Key Features of the Script\n\n**Prerequisites Handled:**\n- Python 3.10+ (detected and installed if missing)\n- pip3 (installed if missing)\n- build-essential (for compiling scientific packages)\n- python3-dev (development headers)\n\n**Functions Implemented:**\n1. `check_prerequisites()` - Detects existing Python/pip installations\n2. `install_prerequisites()` - Installs missing prerequisites (supports Ubuntu/Debian, RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, Alpine)\n3. `verify_prerequisites()` - Verifies prerequisites work correctly\n4. `check_existing_installation()` - Checks for SALib (idempotency)\n5. `install_tool()` - Installs SALib==1.4.7 via pip\n6. `validate()` - Validates installation using: `python3 -c 'import SALib; print(SALib.__version__)'`\n\n**Standards Compliance:**\n- \u2705 Idempotent (re-run = no changes, exits 0)\n- \u2705 Version pinned (1.4.7)\n- \u2705 Non-interactive (DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive)\n- \u2705 Cache cleaned after installation\n- \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n- \u2705 Graceful error handling\n- \u2705 No secrets embedded\n- \u2705 Shellcheck compliant\n\n### Installation Dependencies\n\nSALib v1.4.7 automatically installs these Python dependencies:\n- numpy 2.2.6\n- pandas 2.3.3\n- scipy 1.15.3\n- matplotlib 3.10.6\n- multiprocess 0.70.18\n- And various supporting packages (pillow, fonttools, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"SALib v1.4.7 installation is relatively straightforward with low-to-moderate complexity.
