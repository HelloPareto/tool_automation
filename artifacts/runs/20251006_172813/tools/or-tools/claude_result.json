  "claude_response": "I'll install or-tools v9.14 following the specified standards. Let me start by analyzing the requirements and creating the installation script.\n\n## Analysis\n\nOR-Tools is Google's operations research toolkit. Based on the GitHub analysis:\n- **Binary releases available**: Pattern `or-tools_amd64_almalinux-9_cpp_v9.14.6206.tar.gz`\n- **Go install option**: `github.com/google/or-tools@v9.14`\n- **Make option**: Available for building from source\n\n**Prerequisites needed**:\n- For binary: Standard system libraries (glibc, etc.)\n- For Go install: Go runtime\n- Build tools if compiling from source\n\nI'll use the **binary release** method as it's the most straightforward and reliable.\n\nLet me proceed with the installation:\n\n## Step 1: Create Directory Structure\n## Step 2: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 3: Verify Script Was Saved\nGood! Script saved successfully. Now let's validate it.\n\n## Step 4: Validate the Script\nGood! The bash syntax check passes (no output = success). Shellcheck only shows warnings about unused variables, which are intentional constants for documentation. These are not errors and the script is valid.\n\n## Step 5: Test in Docker\n\nLet me create the Docker test environment:\nNow let's build and test the Docker image:\nThe download URL returned a 404 error. Let me check what versions are actually available on the GitHub releases page:\nLet me try a different approach - checking the actual GitHub releases API:\nLet me try fetching the GitHub releases page directly to get the actual asset list:\nPerfect! The URL exists, but I was using the wrong pattern. The actual filename is `or-tools_amd64_ubuntu-22.04_cpp_v9.14.6206.tar.gz` (with hyphen in ubuntu-22.04, not underscore). Let me update the script:\nWait, the script already has the correct URL format with hyphen. Let me check what the actual download URL should be. The issue is that the script uses \"ubuntu-22.04\" (with hyphen) which is correct. Let me verify by actually checking what v9.14 means - it might be that v9.14 is not the same as v9.14.6206:\nExcellent! The correct tag is `v9.14` not `v9.14.6206`. Let me update the script:\nGood! Now let's re-validate and test again:\nPerfect! Both pass. Now let's update the test files and rebuild:\nThere's an issue with the `download_and_verify()` function - it's echoing the download_dir incorrectly. The log messages are being included in the returned value. Let me fix this:\nI see the issue. The function returns the download_dir with `echo`, but log messages are also going to stdout and getting captured. I need to redirect log output to stderr. Let me fix this:\nPerfect! Now let's test again:\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded! Now let's test running one of the binaries:\nPerfect! The tool is working. Now let's test idempotency by running the script again:\nPerfect! The script is idempotent - it detected the existing installation and validated it without reinstalling. Now let's clean up:\nExcellent! Let me create a final summary and provide the complexity assessment.\n\n## Summary\n\n### \u2705 Installation Complete\n\nI've successfully created and tested the OR-Tools v9.14 installation script. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**Binary Release** - Downloaded the pre-compiled C++ binary package for Ubuntu 22.04 from GitHub releases.\n\n### Script Location\n```\n/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/or-tools/tool_setup.sh\n```\n\n### Key Features Implemented\n\n1. **\u2705 Prerequisites Detection & Installation**\n   - Checks for curl/wget, tar, glibc, libstdc++\n   - Automatically installs missing prerequisites via apt-get/yum/dnf\n   - Verifies all prerequisites before proceeding\n\n2. **\u2705 Idempotent**\n   - Detects existing installations\n   - Validates version matches before reinstalling\n   - Tested successfully - second run skipped installation\n\n3. **\u2705 Version Pinned**\n   - Exact version: v9.14 (9.14.6206)\n   - Downloads from specific GitHub release tag\n\n4. **\u2705 Non-Interactive**\n   - No user prompts\n   - Uses DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n\n5. **\u2705 Verification**\n   - Archive integrity check via tar\n   - Post-installation validation by testing binaries\n   - Version tracking via VERSION.txt file\n\n6. **\u2705 Clean Installation**\n   - Cleans package manager caches\n   - Removes temporary download files\n   - Sets up proper library paths with ldconfig\n\n7. **\u2705 Validation Passed**\n   - shellcheck: Only harmless warnings about unused variables\n   - bash -n: Syntax check passed\n   - Docker build: Successful\n   - Docker runtime test: Binaries work correctly\n   - Idempotency test: Passed\n\n### Installation Details\n\n- **Download Source**: GitHub releases (https://github.com/google/or-tools/releases)\n- **Binary Package**: or-tools_amd64_ubuntu-22.04_cpp_v9.14.6206.tar.gz\n- **Install Location**: /usr/local/or-tools\n- **Binaries**: 9 executables including solve, fzn-cp-sat, scip, highs\n- **Libraries**: 110 shared libraries\n- **Architecture Support**: x86_64 (amd64) and arm64\n\n### Tested Successfully\n- \u2705 Fresh installation in Docker\n- \u2705 Binary execution (`solve --help` works)\n- \u2705 Idempotency (re-running script skips installation)\n- \u2705 Version detection and validation\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"OR-Tools installation has medium-low complexity.
