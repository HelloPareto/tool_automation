  "claude_response": "I'll install statsforecast following the specifications. Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nBased on the tool analysis:\n- **Primary requirement**: Python 3 with pip\n- **Tool type**: Python package (statsforecast)\n- **Installation method**: pip install\n- **Prerequisites needed**:\n  1. Python 3 (python3)\n  2. pip (python3-pip)\n  3. Build tools (build-essential) - statsforecast likely has native components based on the package name statsforecast._lib\n\n## Step 3: Check PyPI for version information\nGood! The latest version is **2.0.2**. Now I'll generate the installation script.\n\n## Step 4: Generate the installation script\n## Step 5: Verify the script was saved correctly\nGood! The script was saved successfully. \n\n## Step 6: Validate the script with shellcheck and bash syntax check\nExcellent! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed with no errors.\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nI see the issue! The validation command uses `python` but only `python3` is installed. Let me fix the validation function in the script:\nNow let me update the Docker test files and run the test again:\nThe build timed out due to slow download speeds. Let me check if the build actually completed and test the validation separately. Let me try a simpler approach - just build without cache and with a longer timeout, or test the validation directly:\nThe image wasn't created. Let me try a different approach - test the script by running it with a cached build (which should be faster):\nGood progress! The installation succeeded, but the validation command is incorrect. The module `statsforecast._lib` doesn't have a `__version__` attribute. Let me check what the correct validation should be:\nLet me check the correct way to validate statsforecast. Based on the error, `statsforecast._lib` doesn't have `__version__`. The validation command provided by the user may be incorrect. Let me use a more standard validation approach:\nNow let's test again with the corrected validation command:\nPerfect! The Docker build succeeded! Now let's run the validation command in the container and then clean up:\nExcellent! The validation works perfectly. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Now let me verify the final script with shellcheck one more time:\nExcellent! Let me provide a comprehensive summary:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Installation Summary - statsforecast v2.0.2\n\n### Completed Successfully\n\nAll steps have been completed successfully for installing **statsforecast version 2.0.2**.\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**pip (Python Package Manager)**\n\n### Script Location\n```\n/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/statsforecas/tool_setup.sh\n```\n\n### Prerequisites Detected and Handled\n1. **Python 3** - Required for running the package\n2. **pip3** - Required for package installation\n3. **gcc** - Required for compiling native extensions\n4. **make** - Required for building native components\n5. **build-essential** - Complete build toolchain for C/C++ compilation\n\n### Validation Steps Completed\n\n\u2705 **Script Generation** - Complete installation script with prerequisite handling  \n\u2705 **Shellcheck** - Passed with no warnings or errors  \n\u2705 **Bash Syntax Check** - Passed with no syntax errors  \n\u2705 **Docker Build Test** - Successfully built and installed in clean Ubuntu 22.04 container  \n\u2705 **Validation Command** - Confirmed version 2.0.2 installed correctly  \n\u2705 **Cleanup** - Docker image and temporary files removed  \n\n### Key Features of the Installation Script\n\n1. **Idempotency** - Can be run multiple times safely\n2. **Prerequisite Detection** - Checks for existing installations before installing\n3. **Version Pinning** - Installs exactly version 2.0.2 (not \"latest\")\n4. **Non-Interactive** - Fully automated with no prompts\n5. **Error Handling** - Clear error messages with remediation steps\n6. **Logging** - Timestamped logs for all major operations\n7. **Validation** - Verifies installation and version match\n\n### Note on Validation Command\n\nThe original validation command provided (`python -c 'import statsforecast._lib; print(statsforecast._lib.__version__)'`) was corrected to:\n```bash\npython3 -c 'import statsforecast; print(statsforecast.__version__)'\n```\n\nThis is because:\n- The module `statsforecast._lib` doesn't expose a `__version__` attribute\n- The main `statsforecast` package has the version information\n- Using `python3` explicitly ensures compatibility with Ubuntu systems\n\n### Test Results\n\nThe Docker test confirmed:\n- Installation completed in ~104 seconds\n- All dependencies installed successfully (23 packages total)\n- Validation returned correct version: **2.0.2**\n- Script follows all installation standards\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"statsforecast is a moderately complex Python package requiring compilation of native extensions.
