  "claude_response": "I'll install dbt-core version v1.11.0b2 following the specified standards. Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Detect Prerequisites\n\nFor dbt-core, I need to analyze the requirements:\n- **Primary prerequisite**: Python 3 (Python package)\n- **Package manager**: pip (Python package installer)\n- **Installation method**: pip install (since it's marked as binary_release but is actually a Python package)\n- The validation command `python -c 'import dbt_core; print(dbt_core.__version__)'` confirms this is a Python package\n\n## Step 3: Choose Installation Method\n\nThis is a Python package, so I'll use pip installation. The version v1.11.0b2 is a beta release that needs to be specifically pinned.\n\n## Step 4: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 5: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2713 Script saved successfully\n\n## Step 6: Validate the Script\nThe bash syntax check passed! Shellcheck found only warnings (SC2155) about declaring and assigning variables separately. These are minor style warnings and don't affect functionality, but let me fix them to pass cleanly.\nNow let's re-run shellcheck to verify all warnings are fixed:\n\u2713 Shellcheck passed with no warnings!\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded. Now let's run the validation command:\nPerfect! The validation returned the exact version `1.11.0b2` as expected. Now let's test idempotency by running the script again:\nExcellent! The script is idempotent - it detected that dbt-core v1.11.0b2 was already installed and exited successfully with code 0 without reinstalling.\n\n## Step 8: Cleanup\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Installation Summary\n\n### \u2705 **All Steps Completed Successfully**\n\n**Installation Details:**\n- **Tool**: dbt-core\n- **Version**: v1.11.0b2\n- **Installation Method**: pip (Python package manager)\n- **Script Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/dbt-core/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### \u2705 **Validation Results**\n\n1. **Script Created**: \u2713 Successfully saved to correct location\n2. **Shellcheck**: \u2713 Passed with no warnings or errors\n3. **Bash Syntax**: \u2713 Passed syntax validation\n4. **Docker Build**: \u2713 Built successfully\n5. **Installation Test**: \u2713 Installed dbt-core v1.11.0b2 correctly\n6. **Validation Command**: \u2713 Returns correct version `1.11.0b2`\n7. **Idempotency Test**: \u2713 Re-running script exits 0 without reinstalling\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Key Features Implemented**\n\n**Prerequisites Management:**\n- \u2705 Detects Python 3.8+ availability\n- \u2705 Checks for pip3 and venv module\n- \u2705 Installs missing prerequisites automatically\n- \u2705 Verifies prerequisites before proceeding\n\n**Installation Standards:**\n- \u2705 Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)\n- \u2705 Version pinned to exactly v1.11.0b2\n- \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n- \u2705 Proper error handling with actionable messages\n- \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n- \u2705 Cache cleanup after installation\n\n**Script Quality:**\n- \u2705 Uses `set -euo pipefail` for safety\n- \u2705 Passes shellcheck with no warnings\n- \u2705 Follows function order: check \u2192 install \u2192 verify \u2192 validate\n- \u2705 Proper exit codes and error messages\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"dbt-core installation has low complexity.
