  "claude_response": "I'll install climada_python version v6.1.0 following the specifications. Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Create the directory structure\n## Step 2: Analyze Prerequisites\n\nBased on the documentation and validation command, I need to identify:\n- **Primary prerequisite**: Python 3 (for pip installation and running the tool)\n- **Package manager**: pip (Python package manager)\n- **Installation method**: pip install (the documentation mentions conda, but we're using pip as specified)\n- **System dependencies**: The tool appears to be a scientific Python package (CLIMADA for climate adaptation), which may require numerical computing libraries\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n\nNow I'll create a comprehensive installation script with proper prerequisite handling:\n## Step 4: Verify the script was saved\nGood! The script was saved successfully. Now let's validate it.\n\n## Step 5: Validate with shellcheck and bash syntax\nExcellent! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed with no errors.\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\n\nNow let's create a Docker test environment:\nI see the issue - Python 3 is installed but pip3 is not being installed properly by the system packages. Let me fix the script:\nNow let's also update the pip upgrade section to handle cases where pip module might not be available:\nNow let's validate the updated script again:\nGood! Now let's copy the updated script and retry the Docker build:\nGood progress! The prerequisites are installed correctly now. However, the package name/version combination is wrong. Let me check PyPI for the correct package:\nLet me check the actual package name on PyPI:\nPerfect! The package name on PyPI is just **`climada`** (not `climada-python`), and version 6.1.0 exists! Let me update the script:\nNow let's validate and test again:\nI see the issue - there's a version conflict with GDAL. The system has GDAL 3.4.1, but the climada package requires GDAL 3.11.4. This is a complex dependency issue typical with scientific Python packages. Let me update the script to install a newer version of GDAL or adjust the approach:\nActually, looking at the documentation again, the recommended installation method is via conda, not pip. But since we're using pip, we need to let climada install its own GDAL dependency. Let me check if there's a way to install without that dependency or use a different approach. Let me validate and try the updated version:\nThe issue is that GDAL needs to be present. Let me add libgdal-dev back, which provides the gdal-config tool needed:\nNow I need to add a workaround for the GDAL version mismatch. Let me modify the install_tool() function to handle this:\nLet me validate and test again:\nGreat progress! climada-6.1.0 was successfully installed, but the validation is failing. The issue is the validation command was provided by the user uses `climada_python` but the actual package imports as `climada`. Let me check what the actual error is by looking at the import:\nLet me test again to see what the actual error is:\nPerfect! Now I see the issue. The climada module doesn't have a `__version__` attribute. The user's validation command is incorrect. However, I need to work with the provided validation command. Let me check what the correct way to get the version is. Looking at the error, the module imports fine, it just doesn't have a `__version__` attribute. Let me check if there's a different location:\nPerfect! The issue is that the user's validation command is incorrect. The climada module doesn't expose `__version__` at the top level. I should use `importlib.metadata.version()` instead. However, since the user provided a specific validation command, I need to note this and provide a working alternative. Let me update the validation to use the correct method while noting the issue:\nNow let's also check if climada can be imported at all for the idempotency check:\nNow let's validate and test again:\nLet me fix that shellcheck warning:\nExcellent! The installation was successful! Now let's run the final validation test:\nPerfect! Let's also test idempotency by running the script again:\nExcellent! The script is idempotent. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! Now let's verify the final script one more time:\nPerfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n---\n\n## Installation Summary\n\n\u2705 **All steps completed successfully!**\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**pip** (Python Package Manager) - The climada package is available on PyPI as `climada` (not `climada-python` as initially indicated).\n\n### Script Location\nThe installation script has been saved to:\n```\n/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_182420/tools/climada_python/tool_setup.sh\n```\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n1. **Prerequisites Detected and Installed:**\n   - Python 3.10+ (required for climada)\n   - pip3 (Python package manager)\n   - gcc and build-essential (for compiling Python extensions)\n   - Scientific computing libraries:\n     - gfortran (Fortran compiler)\n     - libgeos-dev (GEOS library)\n     - libproj-dev (PROJ library)\n     - libhdf5-dev (HDF5 library)\n     - libnetcdf-dev (NetCDF library)\n     - libgdal-dev and gdal-bin (GDAL library with matching Python bindings)\n\n2. **Installation Process:**\n   - System GDAL version is detected (3.4.1 on Ubuntu 22.04)\n   - Matching GDAL Python bindings are installed first\n   - climada 6.1.0 is then installed via pip\n   - All 70+ dependencies are automatically resolved\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - **Note:** The original validation command provided (`python -c 'import climada_python; print(climada_python.__version__)'`) was incorrect\n   - The script uses the correct validation: `import importlib.metadata; print(importlib.metadata.version(\"climada\"))`\n   - This is the standard Python way to get package versions\n\n4. **Validation Results:**\n   - \u2705 Shellcheck passed (no errors)\n   - \u2705 Bash syntax check passed\n   - \u2705 Docker build succeeded\n   - \u2705 Installation validated successfully (version 6.1.0 confirmed)\n   - \u2705 Idempotency confirmed (re-running script detects existing installation and exits cleanly)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Status\n- \u2705 Prerequisites detected, checked, installed, and verified\n- \u2705 Script is idempotent\n- \u2705 Version pinned (6.1.0)\n- \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n- \u2705 Uses approved repos and keyring locations\n- \u2705 Cleans caches after installation\n- \u2705 Validation works and returns expected version\n- \u2705 Shellcheck and bash -n pass\n- \u2705 No secrets in script\n- \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps and actionable error messages\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"CLIMADA is a complex scientific Python package with extensive dependencies requiring careful system-level prerequisite management.
