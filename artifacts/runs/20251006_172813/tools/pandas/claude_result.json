  "claude_response": "I'll install pandas version v2.3.3 following the specifications. Let me start by creating the directory structure and analyzing the installation requirements.\n\n## Step 1: Create Directory Structure\n## Step 2: Prerequisites Analysis\n\nFor pandas v2.3.3, the prerequisites are:\n- **Python 3** (required runtime)\n- **pip3** (required for installation)\n- Python development headers may be needed for some dependencies\n\n## Step 3: Installation Method Selection\n\nSince the package manager is specified as `binary_release` but pandas is primarily distributed via PyPI (pip), I'll use **pip installation** as the most reliable method. The version v2.3.3 corresponds to pandas version 2.3.3 available on PyPI.\n\n## Step 4: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 5: Verify Script Was Saved\n\u2705 Script saved successfully!\n\n## Step 6: Validate the Script\nGood! The bash syntax validation passed. There's only a minor shellcheck warning about an unused variable (PYTHON_MIN_VERSION), which is harmless. Let me fix this to make shellcheck completely happy:\nNow let's re-run shellcheck to confirm it's clean:\n\u2705 **Shellcheck passed with no warnings!**\n\n\u2705 **Bash syntax validation passed!**\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nGreat! The Docker build completed successfully. Now let's verify the installation by running the validation command:\nPerfect! \u2705 **pandas version 2.3.3 is correctly installed and validated!**\n\nNow let's test idempotency by running the script again:\nExcellent! \u2705 **Idempotency confirmed** - the script detected that pandas is already installed and exited successfully without reinstalling.\n\nNow let's clean up:\nPerfect! Clean-up completed successfully.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Installation Summary\n\n### \u2705 All Steps Completed Successfully\n\n**Installation Method:** pip (Python Package Installer)\n\n**Script Location:** `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251006_172813/tools/pandas/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Validation Results:\n\n\u2705 **Prerequisites Detected:**\n- Python 3.10.12\n- pip3 22.0.2\n\n\u2705 **Script Validation:**\n- Shellcheck: Passed (no warnings)\n- Bash syntax check: Passed\n\n\u2705 **Docker Testing:**\n- Build: Successful\n- Installation: pandas 2.3.3 installed correctly\n- Validation: Version matches expected (2.3.3)\n- Idempotency: Confirmed - re-running script detects existing installation\n\n\u2705 **Acceptance Criteria Met:**\n- \u2713 Prerequisites detected and documented\n- \u2713 Prerequisites checked before installing\n- \u2713 Prerequisites installed automatically\n- \u2713 Prerequisites verified before tool installation\n- \u2713 Script is idempotent\n- \u2713 Version pinned (2.3.3)\n- \u2713 Non-interactive installation\n- \u2713 Cache cleaned after installation\n- \u2713 Validation command works correctly\n- \u2713 Shellcheck and bash -n pass\n- \u2713 No secrets in script\n- \u2713 Clear logging with timestamps\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Installing pandas is a straightforward process with low complexity.
