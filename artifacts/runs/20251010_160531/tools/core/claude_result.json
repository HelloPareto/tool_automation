  "claude_response": "I'll install LibreOffice core following the specifications. Let me start by researching the repository and understanding the installation method.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the Repository\nLet me search for more specific information about the bundles and binary distributions.\nLet me check the official LibreOffice download page to understand the latest version and download URLs.\nNow let me fetch the actual download link to understand the file structure.\nPerfect! Now let me get the checksum for verification.\nExcellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the directory structure and generate the installation script.\n\n## Step 2: Create Directory Structure\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n\nBased on my research, LibreOffice is distributed as a pre-built binary package (tar.gz containing .deb files). The installation requires:\n- Prerequisites: Basic system utilities (curl, tar, dpkg)\n- No compilation needed\n- Installation method: Download tar.gz, extract, install deb packages\n## Step 4: Create Tool Manifest\n## Step 5: Verify Script was Saved\nGood! The script was saved successfully. Now let me validate it with shellcheck and bash syntax check.\n\n## Step 6: Validate the Script\nThe shellcheck warnings are minor (unused variables) but the bash syntax check passed. Let me fix those warnings by removing the unused variables.\nNow let me re-run shellcheck to confirm it passes cleanly.\nPerfect! Shellcheck passes with no warnings. Now let's test the script in Docker.\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nNow let's build the Docker image. Since LibreOffice is a large package, I'll set a 30-minute timeout.\nGreat! The Docker image built successfully. Now let's run the container and execute the installation script.\nThe output appears to be cut off, but I can see the installation process is working. Let me check if the installation completed successfully by running a simpler test:\nThe installation appears to be hanging or taking a very long time. Let me try a different approach - test if the script completes successfully by running a simpler version:\nLet me try a different approach to test the installation:\nI see the issue! LibreOffice is installed successfully but the binary is not in the expected PATH. Let me check where LibreOffice installs its binary and fix the script:\nLet me install LibreOffice first then check:\nPerfect! Now I found the issue. LibreOffice installs to `/opt/libreoffice25.8/program/soffice`. Let me also check if there are any wrapper scripts:\nGood! Now let me check if there's a `libreoffice` wrapper script in `/usr/bin`:\nNow I understand the issue. The LibreOffice deb packages install to `/opt/libreoffice25.8/program/` but don't create any symlinks in `/usr/bin`. I need to update the script to create the proper symlinks. Let me fix this:\nNow let me verify shellcheck still passes:\nGreat! Now let's rebuild the Docker image and test again:\nGood! Now let's test the updated script:\nI can see two issues:\n1. Missing `libXinerama.so.1` - This library is needed but wasn't installed\n2. The `core --version` command fails because of the missing library\n\nThe issue is that our script didn't properly install all the runtime dependencies at the beginning. The `install_prerequisites()` function should have installed `libxinerama1`, which is already in the list, but it's not being called because the base Docker image already has `curl` and `tar`. Let me check what's happening:\nThe library is not installed. The problem is that `check_prerequisites()` only checks for basic tools (curl, tar, dpkg, sha256sum) but doesn't check for LibreOffice runtime libraries. Let me fix the script to handle this better:\nNow let's verify shellcheck passes and rebuild:\nNow let's test again:\nPerfect! The installation now works successfully! Let me also test idempotency by running the script twice:\nExcellent! The script is idempotent. Now let's clean up the Docker test environment:\nPerfect! Now let me verify the final script and manifest files are in place:\nPerfect! Let me provide a final summary of the installation.\n\n---\n\n## Installation Summary\n\nI have successfully created an installation script for LibreOffice Core version 25.8.2 following all specifications.\n\n### Installation Method Used\n**Pre-built Binary Package Download** - LibreOffice distributes official `.deb` packages in a tar.gz archive from https://download.documentfoundation.org/. This is the recommended method as stated in the GitHub repository description (\"don't download zip, use https://dev-www.libreoffice.org/bundles/\").\n\n### Key Features Implemented\n\n1. **Repository Analysis**: \n   - Researched the official LibreOffice download sources\n   - Identified version 25.8.2 as the latest stable release\n   - Located official download URL with SHA256 checksum verification\n\n2. **Prerequisite Management**:\n   - Basic tools: curl, tar, dpkg, sha256sum\n   - Runtime libraries: 30+ LibreOffice dependencies including libxinerama1, libgl1, libcairo2, libxml2, libxslt1.1, boost libraries, etc.\n   - All prerequisites checked before installation\n   - Automatic installation of missing prerequisites\n\n3. **Script Features**:\n   - \u2705 Idempotent (tested - second run detects existing installation)\n   - \u2705 Version pinned to 25.8.2 with SHA256 verification\n   - \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n   - \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n   - \u2705 Graceful error handling\n   - \u2705 Shellcheck passes with no warnings\n   - \u2705 Bash syntax validation passes\n   - \u2705 Docker tested and validated\n\n4. **Installation Process**:\n   - Downloads 202MB tar.gz package\n   - Verifies SHA256 checksum\n   - Extracts and installs 43 .deb packages\n   - Creates symlinks: `/usr/bin/libreoffice`, `/usr/bin/soffice`, `/usr/local/bin/core`\n   - Validates installation with `core --version`\n\n5. **Validation**:\n   - Command: `core --version`\n   - Expected output: `LibreOffice 25.8.2.2 d401f2107ccab8f924a8e2df40f573aab7605b6f`\n   - \u2705 Tested successfully in Docker\n\n### Files Created\n\n1. **tool_setup.sh** - Main installation script (14KB)\n2. **tool_manifest.json** - Metadata describing prerequisites and configuration\n\n### Test Results\n\n- \u2705 Shellcheck: PASSED\n- \u2705 Bash syntax check: PASSED  \n- \u2705 Docker build: PASSED\n- \u2705 Docker run with installation: PASSED\n- \u2705 Validation command: PASSED\n- \u2705 Idempotency test: PASSED\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"LibreOffice installation has medium-high complexity due to the large number of system library prerequisites (30+ packages) required for the office suite to function properly.
