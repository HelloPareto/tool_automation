  "claude_response": "I'll install PyMC v5.25.1 following the specifications. Let me start by analyzing the repository to determine the best installation method.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Repository\nLet me check the PyPI page for more details about pip installation and dependencies:\nNow let me check the GitHub repository to understand the full dependency tree:\nPerfect! Now let me clean up and check if there's a validate command issue - PyMC is a Python library, not a CLI tool:\n## Analysis Summary\n\nBased on my research:\n\n1. **Tool Type**: PyMC is a Python library, not a CLI tool\n2. **Installation Method**: pip install (simple)\n3. **Prerequisites**: \n   - Python 3.10+ \n   - Various Python dependencies (arviz, numpy, pandas, pytensor, scipy, etc.)\n   - No system libraries or compilation needed\n4. **Validation**: PyMC doesn't provide a `pymc --version` command. It's a Python library that must be validated with `python3 -c \"import pymc; print(pymc.__version__)\"`\n\n## Step 2: Create Installation Directory\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 4: Create Tool Manifest\n## Step 5: Verify Script Saved Correctly\nGood! Script is saved correctly. \n\n## Step 6: Validate the Script\nExcellent! Both shellcheck and bash syntax validation passed without errors.\n\n## Step 7: Test in Docker\nGreat! Docker image built successfully. Now let's test running the installation script:\nPerfect! Installation completed successfully! Now let's verify with the validation command:\nThat's expected - we need to run the installation script first. Let's run the full test including the validation:\nPerfect! The validation shows **5.25.1** - exactly the version we wanted. Now let's test idempotency by running the script twice:\nExcellent! The second run correctly detected that PyMC v5.25.1 was already installed and skipped the installation step, proving **idempotency**. \n\nNow let's clean up the Docker test:\nPerfect! Now let me verify the final location of the script and manifest:\nPerfect! Both files are in place. Let me verify the manifest content:\nPerfect! Everything is in place. Now let me create the final summary:\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 PyMC v5.25.1 Installation - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY\n\n## Summary\n\nPyMC v5.25.1 has been successfully installed and validated. The installation script and manifest have been saved to the specified location.\n\n## Installation Details\n\n### Repository Analysis\n- **Repository**: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc\n- **Tool Type**: Python library for Bayesian statistical modeling\n- **Installation Method**: **pip** (Python package manager)\n- **Official Documentation**: https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/installation.html\n\n### Prerequisites Identified\n1. **Python 3.10+** (required minimum version)\n2. **pip3** (Python package installer)\n3. **build-essential** (for C extension compilation in dependencies)\n4. **Scientific computing libraries**: libopenblas-dev, liblapack-dev, gfortran (for scipy, numpy dependencies)\n\n### Installation Approach\nPyMC is a pure Python package distributed via PyPI. The installation uses:\n- Direct pip installation: `pip3 install pymc==5.25.1`\n- Installs 40+ dependencies including: arviz, numpy, pandas, pytensor, scipy, matplotlib, xarray\n- No compilation required for PyMC itself (pure Python)\n- Some dependencies (numpy, scipy, pytensor) have pre-compiled wheels\n\n## Files Created\n\n### 1. Installation Script\n**Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251010_160531/tools/pymc/tool_setup.sh`\n\n**Features**:\n- \u2705 Prerequisite detection and installation (Python 3.10+, pip3, build tools)\n- \u2705 Idempotent design (safe to run multiple times)\n- \u2705 Version pinning (exactly v5.25.1)\n- \u2705 Self-healing runtime linkage verification\n- \u2705 Comprehensive logging with timestamps\n- \u2705 Support for `--skip-prereqs` flag\n- \u2705 Follows `set -euo pipefail` best practices\n- \u2705 Graceful error handling with actionable messages\n\n### 2. Tool Manifest\n**Location**: `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251010_160531/tools/pymc/tool_manifest.json`\n\n**Contents**:\n- Prerequisites: python3, python3-pip, python3-venv, python3-dev, build-essential, scientific libs\n- Validation command: `python3 -c \"import pymc; print(pymc.__version__)\"`\n- Requires compilation: false\n\n## Validation Results\n\n### \u2705 Shellcheck\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- No warnings or errors\n\n### \u2705 Bash Syntax Check\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Syntax is valid\n\n### \u2705 Docker Test\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- Installation completed successfully in Ubuntu 22.04 container\n- All dependencies installed correctly (40+ packages)\n- Validation confirmed: `pymc.__version__ == \"5.25.1\"`\n- Installation time: ~26 minutes (due to large dependency tree)\n\n### \u2705 Idempotency Test\n- **Status**: PASSED\n- First run: Installed PyMC v5.25.1\n- Second run: Detected existing installation, skipped installation, validated successfully\n- Exit code: 0 on both runs\n\n## Acceptance Checklist\n\n| Criteria | Status | Notes |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| Prerequisites detected | \u2705 | Python 3.10+, pip3, build-essential |\n| Prerequisites checked | \u2705 | Version validation included |\n| Prerequisites installed | \u2705 | Automatic installation when missing |\n| Prerequisites verified | \u2705 | Post-install verification |\n| Idempotent | \u2705 | Tested with double-run |\n| Version pinned | \u2705 | Exactly v5.25.1 |\n| Non-interactive | \u2705 | DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive |\n| Approved repos | \u2705 | PyPI for package, apt for prerequisites |\n| Cache management | \u2705 | Using --no-cache-dir for pip |\n| Validation works | \u2705 | Returns correct version |\n| Shellcheck passes | \u2705 | No errors |\n| No secrets | \u2705 | No credentials in script |\n| Clear logging | \u2705 | Timestamps and color-coded messages |\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"PyMC installation has low complexity as it's a pure Python package installed via pip.
