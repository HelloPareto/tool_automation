    "logs": "I'll validate the multi-tool composition with self-healing capabilities. Let me start by building the image and running the container.\nGood! The image built successfully. Now let's run the container with the entrypoint script.\nThe container timed out after 10 minutes. This is likely because the PyMC installation is taking a very long time to download and install dependencies (we can see it was downloading scipy which is 37.7 MB and there are likely more dependencies). Let me check the run_all.sh script to understand what's happening and potentially increase the timeout or optimize the process.\nI can see the script is installing all tools in sequence. The issue is that PyMC is taking too long to install. Let me run the container again with a much longer timeout (20 minutes) to see if it can complete:\nThe output was truncated. Let me check if there's a success message at the end of the log:\nGood! The pymc installation succeeded. Now let me check if the final success message was printed:\nThe success message is not present. Let me check the run_all.sh script again to see what should print the success message:\nThe log shows all three tools (core, metabase, pymc) were installed and validated successfully, but the script didn't print the final \"COMPOSE_VALIDATION_SUCCESS\" message. Looking back at the run_all.sh script, I see it only has validation commands but no final success message. Let me check if there's supposed to be a success message added to the script:\nI see the issue - the run_all.sh script is missing the final success message. According to the procedure, I need to add a \"COMPOSE_VALIDATION_SUCCESS\" message at the end. Let me add it:\nGood! Now I need to rebuild the image with the updated run_all.sh script and run it again:\nGreat! The image was rebuilt. Now let's run the container again. Since I know the process takes about 5-6 minutes based on the previous run, I'll use a shorter validation run to just check if the success message appears:\nThe command timed out again. Let me check the output that was captured:\nThe log shows it's still downloading PyMC dependencies. The process is taking much longer on the second run - it seems like the downloads are slower. Let me run a simpler test: since we've already confirmed the container works from the first run, let me just run the validation quickly by skipping the full install and just checking if all three validations pass. Let me check if there's already a cached Docker image from our successful first run:\nPerfect! We have the latest image. Now let me run it one more time but with better output handling. Since the process is slow due to network downloads, let me try a different approach - run it in the background and monitor the output:\nGood, it's running. Let me wait for it to complete. I'll check periodically:\nGood! It's progressing through the tools. Core is done, and now it's downloading Metabase. Let me continue monitoring:\nGood! Metabase is done and now it's installing PyMC. The numpy package is being downloaded. Let me continue monitoring:\nPerfect! **COMPOSE_VALIDATION_SUCCESS** has been printed! \ud83c\udf89\n\nLet me verify the background process has completed:\nExcellent! The background process has completed with exit code 0 (success). Let me now verify the complete output and confirm all validations passed:\nPerfect! Let me also verify the actual validation outputs for each tool:\nExcellent! All three tools have been validated successfully with their correct versions:\n- **core (LibreOffice)**: 25.8.2.2 \u2713\n- **metabase**: v0.56.9 \u2713  \n- **pymc**: 5.25.1 \u2713\n\nAnd the final **COMPOSE_VALIDATION_SUCCESS** message was printed.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Multi-tool composition validation completed successfully!**\n\n### Validation Results:\n\n1. **Build**: Docker image `compose_20251010_160531` built successfully\n2. **Run**: Container executed the `/workspace/run_all.sh` script without errors\n3. **Tools Validated**:\n   - \u2705 **core (LibreOffice 25.8.2.2)** - Installation and validation successful\n   - \u2705 **metabase (v0.56.9)** - Installation and validation successful  \n   - \u2705 **pymc (5.25.1)** - Installation and validation successful\n\n4. **Self-Healing**: \n   - One minor fix was required: Added the `COMPOSE_VALIDATION_SUCCESS` message to the `run_all.sh` script\n   - Rebuilt the image and re-ran successfully\n\n5. **Final Status**: **COMPOSE_VALIDATION_SUCCESS** printed \u2713\n\nThe compose validation demonstrates that all three tools can be installed together in a single Docker container, their dependencies are compatible, and all validation commands execute successfully."
