  "claude_response": "I'll install Metabase v0.56.8 following the specifications. Let me start by researching the repository to determine the best installation method.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Repository\nLet me fetch more specific details about the JAR file and verify the exact download URL for v0.56.8:\nPerfect! Now let me check if there's a specific way to run Metabase as a command-line tool and understand how the validation command works:\nNow let me check how to get the version from Metabase:\nExcellent! Now I understand the installation approach. Metabase is a Java JAR file that requires Java 21. The validation command needs to be a wrapper script. Let me create the directory and generate the installation script:\n## Step 2: Prerequisites Detection\n\nBased on my research, Metabase requires:\n1. **Java JRE 21** (recommended version)\n2. **curl/wget** for downloading the JAR file\n\nThe installation method is: **Download the JAR file and create a wrapper script**\n\n## Step 3: Generate Installation Script\n## Step 4: Verify Script Creation\nGood! Script created successfully. Now let's validate it.\n\n## Step 5: Validate the Script with shellcheck and bash syntax\nGood! The bash syntax check passed (no output means success). Shellcheck has only warnings about unused variables, which are acceptable. Now let's create the Dockerfile for testing.\n\n## Step 6: Test in Docker\nNow let's build the Docker image. This may take some time as it needs to download Java and the Metabase JAR file:\nExcellent! The Docker build succeeded. Now let's test the validation command:\nPerfect! The version command works correctly and shows **Metabase v0.56.8**. Now let's clean up:\nPerfect! All cleanup complete. Now let me provide the final summary and complexity assessment.\n\n---\n\n## Installation Summary\n\n### \u2705 Installation Completed Successfully\n\n**Tool:** Metabase v0.56.8  \n**Installation Method:** Binary (JAR file) with wrapper script  \n**Script Location:** `/Users/safiurrehman/Desktop/Pareto/tool_code_automation/artifacts/runs/20251007_164929/tools/metabase/tool_setup.sh`\n\n### Installation Details\n\n1. **Repository Analysis:** \n   - Analyzed the Metabase GitHub repository and official documentation\n   - Determined the best installation method: Download the pre-built JAR file from official releases\n   - JAR URL: `https://downloads.metabase.com/v0.56.8/metabase.jar`\n\n2. **Prerequisites Detected:**\n   - **Java JRE 21** (required for running Metabase)\n   - **curl or wget** (for downloading the JAR file)\n\n3. **Script Features:**\n   - \u2705 Idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)\n   - \u2705 Prerequisite detection and automatic installation\n   - \u2705 Prerequisite verification before proceeding\n   - \u2705 Version pinning (v0.56.8)\n   - \u2705 Non-interactive installation\n   - \u2705 Clear logging with timestamps\n   - \u2705 Download retry mechanism (3 attempts)\n   - \u2705 Proper error handling\n   - \u2705 Creates wrapper script at `/usr/local/bin/metabase`\n   - \u2705 Installs JAR to `/opt/metabase/metabase.jar`\n\n4. **Validation Results:**\n   - \u2705 Shellcheck: Passed (only 2 minor warnings about unused variables)\n   - \u2705 Bash syntax check: Passed\n   - \u2705 Docker build: Successful\n   - \u2705 Version verification: Confirmed **Metabase v0.56.8** is correctly installed\n\n5. **How It Works:**\n   - The script installs OpenJDK 21 if not present\n   - Downloads the Metabase JAR file (approximately 300+ MB)\n   - Creates a wrapper script that handles the `metabase --version` command\n   - The wrapper executes: `java --add-opens java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED -jar /opt/metabase/metabase.jar version`\n\n### Test Results\n\nThe Docker test confirmed:\n- Prerequisites (Java 21) installed successfully\n- Metabase JAR downloaded and installed correctly\n- Wrapper script created and made executable\n- Version command returns: **Metabase v0.56.8 (da08112)**\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Metabase installation has moderate complexity. The primary complexity comes from requiring Java 21 (a large prerequisite ~200MB) and downloading a large JAR file (~300MB).
